<p id="p143" data-pid="143" class="p143 sb"><span id="pos91501"></span><span id="chapter15_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>“Or what woman who has ten drachma coins,<span id="footnotesource152"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote152">*</a> if she loses one of the drachmas,<span id="footnotesource153"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote153">*</a> does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it? <span id="chapter15_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>And when she has found it, she calls her friends<span id="footnotesource154"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote154">*</a> and neighbors together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma coin<span id="footnotesource155"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote155">*</a> that I had lost.’ <span id="chapter15_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>In the same way, I tell you, joy arises among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</p>
<p id="p144" data-pid="144" class="p144 sb"><span id="pos91924"></span><span id="chapter15_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Then he said: “A man had two sons. <span id="chapter15_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>And the younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the property that should come to me.’ So he divided his belongings between them. <span id="chapter15_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>A few days later, the younger son gathered all his things together and traveled to a distant country and there squandered his property by living a debauched<span id="footnotesource156"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote156">*</a> life. <span id="chapter15_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>When he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and he fell into need. <span id="chapter15_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>He even went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to herd swine. <span id="chapter15_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>And he longed to be filled with the carob pods that the swine were eating, but no one would give him anything.</p>
<p id="p145" data-pid="145" class="p145 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have more than enough bread, while I am dying here from hunger! <span id="chapter15_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>I will get up and travel to my father and say to him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. <span id="chapter15_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Make me as one of your hired men.”’ <span id="chapter15_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>So he got up and went to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity, and he ran and embraced him<span id="footnotesource157"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote157">*</a> and tenderly kissed him. <span id="chapter15_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Then the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy of being called your son.’ <span id="chapter15_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quick! bring out a robe, the best one, and clothe him with it, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. <span id="chapter15_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Also bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let us eat and celebrate, <span id="chapter15_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>for this son of mine was dead but has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.’ And they started to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p id="p146" data-pid="146" class="p146 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>“Now his older son was in the field, and as he returned and got near the house, he heard <span id="page1408" class="pageNum" data-no="1408" data-before-text="1408"></span>music and dancing. <span id="chapter15_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>So he called one of the servants to him and asked what was happening. <span id="chapter15_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father slaughtered the fattened calf because he got him back in good health.’<span id="footnotesource158"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote158">*</a> <span id="chapter15_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>But he became angry and refused to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him. <span id="chapter15_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>In reply he said to his father, ‘Look! These many years I have slaved for you and never once did I disobey your orders, and yet you never once gave me a young goat to enjoy with my friends. <span id="chapter15_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>But as soon as this son of yours arrived who squandered<span id="footnotesource159"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote159">*</a> your belongings with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.’ <span id="chapter15_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>Then he said to him, ‘My son, you have always been with me, and all the things that are mine are yours. <span id="chapter15_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>But we just had to celebrate and rejoice, for your brother was dead but has come to life; he was lost and has been found.’”</p>
