<p id="p232" data-pid="232" class="p232 sb"><span id="pos96136"></span><span id="chapter21"></span><span id="chapter21_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>21 </strong></span>Now the men of Israel had sworn this oath in Mizʹpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter to a man from Benjamin as a wife.” <span id="chapter21_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Consequently, the people came to Bethʹel and sat there before the true God until evening, crying out and weeping bitterly. <span id="chapter21_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>And they were saying: “Why, O Jehovah the God of Israel, has this happened in Israel? Why should one tribe be missing today from Israel?” <span id="chapter21_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>And the next day the people got up early and built an altar there to offer up burnt offerings and communion offerings.</p>
<p id="p233" data-pid="233" class="p233 sb"><span id="chapter21_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Then the people of Israel said: “Who of all the tribes of Israel did not come up to assemble before Jehovah?” for they had taken a great oath that anyone who did not come up to Jehovah at Mizʹpah would be put to death without fail. <span id="chapter21_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>So the people of Israel felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin their brother. They said: “Today one tribe has been chopped off from Israel. <span id="chapter21_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>What should we do to provide wives for those who are left, now that we have sworn by Jehovah not to give them any of our daughters as wives?”</p>
<p id="p234" data-pid="234" class="p234 sb"><span id="chapter21_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>They asked: “Who among the tribes of Israel did not come up to Jehovah at Mizʹpah?” It so happened that no one had come from Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad into the camp where the congregation was. <span id="chapter21_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When the people were counted, they saw that none of the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad were there. <span id="chapter21_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>So the assembly sent there 12,000 of the mightiest men. They commanded them: “Go and strike down the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad with the sword, even the women and the children. <span id="chapter21_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>This is what you should do: Every male as well as every woman who has had sexual relations with a male, you should devote to destruction.” <span id="chapter21_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Among the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, they found 400 girls who were virgins, who had never had sexual relations with a man. So they brought them to the camp at Shiʹloh, which is in the land of Caʹnaan.</p>
<p id="p235" data-pid="235" class="p235 sb"><span id="chapter21_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Then all the assembly sent a message to the Benʹja·min·ites on the crag of Rimʹmon and offered them peace. <span id="chapter21_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>So Benjamin came back at that time. They gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, but they did not find enough for them. <span id="chapter21_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>And the people felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin because Jehovah had made a division among the tribes of Israel. <span id="chapter21_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The elders of the assembly said: “What should we do to provide wives for the remaining men, since all the women were annihilated out of Benjamin?” <span id="chapter21_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>They replied: “There should be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe may not be wiped out of Israel. <span id="chapter21_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>But we are not allowed to give them wives from our daughters, because the people <span id="page391" class="pageNum" data-no="391" data-before-text="391"></span>of Israel have sworn: ‘Cursed is the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”</p>
<p id="p236" data-pid="236" class="p236 sb"><span id="chapter21_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Then they said: “Look! There is a festival of Jehovah from year to year in Shiʹloh, which is north of Bethʹel and east of the highway that goes up from Bethʹel to Sheʹchem and south of Le·boʹnah.” <span id="chapter21_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>So they commanded the men of Benjamin: “Go and set an ambush in the vineyards. <span id="chapter21_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>And when you see the young women<span id="footnotesource159"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote159">*</a> of Shiʹloh come out to join in their circle dances, each of you should come out from the vineyards and seize a wife from the young women of Shiʹloh, and you should return to the land of Benjamin. <span id="chapter21_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>And should their fathers or their brothers come to make a complaint against us, we will then tell them, ‘Show us favor for their sakes, because we could not provide each one a wife by war and you could not give a wife to them without becoming guilty.’”</p>
<p id="p237" data-pid="237" class="p237 sb"><span id="chapter21_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>So the men of Benjamin did just that, and they each carried off a wife from the women who were dancing. After that they went back to their inheritance and rebuilt their cities and settled in them.</p>
<p id="p238" data-pid="238" class="p238 sb"><span id="chapter21_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>And the Israelites dispersed from there at that time, each one to his tribe and his family, and they departed from there, each one to his inheritance.</p>
<p id="p239" data-pid="239" class="p239 sb"><span id="chapter21_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>In those days there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.<span id="footnotesource160"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote160">*</a></p>
