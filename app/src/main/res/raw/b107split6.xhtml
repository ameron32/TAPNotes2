He will give it to the owner on the day his guilt is proved. <span id="chapter6_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>And he will bring to the priest as his guilt offering to Jehovah a sound ram from the flock according to the assessed value, for a guilt offering. <span id="chapter6_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah, and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done resulting in his guilt.”</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="p37 sb"><span id="pos18092"></span><span id="chapter6_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: <span id="chapter6_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>“Command Aaron and his sons and say, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering will remain on the hearth on the altar all night long until the morning, and the fire will be kept burning on the altar. <span id="chapter6_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>The priest will clothe himself with his official dress of linen, and he will put the linen shorts<span id="footnotesource37"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote37">*</a> on over his flesh.

It must not go out. The priest must burn wood on it each morning and arrange the burnt offering over it, and he will make the fat of the communion sacrifices smoke over it. <span id="chapter6_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Fire will be kept constantly burning on the altar. It must not go out.</p>

It will be eaten as unleavened bread in a holy place. They will eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. <span id="chapter6_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>It should not be baked with anything leavened. I have given it as their share out of my offerings made by fire. It is something most holy, like the sin offering and like the guilt offering. <span id="chapter6_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Every <span id="page178" class="pageNum" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>male among the sons of Aaron will eat it.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="p39 sb"><span id="chapter6_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Jehovah spoke again to Moses: <span id="chapter6_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>“This is the offering that Aaron and his sons will present to Jehovah on the day he is anointed: the tenth of an eʹphah<span id="footnotesource42"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote42">*</a> of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. <span id="chapter6_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>It will be made with oil on a griddle.

It is a lasting regulation: As a whole offering it will be made to smoke to Jehovah. <span id="chapter6_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Every grain offering of a priest should be a whole offering. It must not be eaten.”</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="p40 sb"><span id="pos20678"></span><span id="chapter6_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Jehovah spoke again to Moses and said: <span id="chapter6_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>“Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering will also be slaughtered before Jehovah.
