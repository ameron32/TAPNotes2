<p id="p270" data-pid="270" class="p270 sb"><span id="pos127591"></span><span id="chapter32"></span><span id="chapter32_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>32 </strong></span>Jacob then went on his way, and the angels of God met up with him. <span id="chapter32_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>As soon as he saw them, Jacob said: “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Ma·ha·naʹim.<span id="footnotesource244"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote244">*</a></p>
<p id="p271" data-pid="271" class="p271 sb"><span id="pos127767"></span><span id="chapter32_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Eʹsau in the land of Seʹir, the territory<span id="footnotesource245"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote245">*</a> of Eʹdom, <span id="chapter32_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>and he commanded them: “This is what you will say to my lord, to Eʹsau, ‘This is what your servant Jacob says: “I have resided<span id="footnotesource246"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote246">*</a> with Laʹban for a long time until now. <span id="chapter32_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>And I have acquired bulls, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants, and I send this message to inform my lord, in order to find favor in your eyes.”’”</p>
<p id="p272" data-pid="272" class="p272 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In time the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: “We met your brother Eʹsau, and he is now on his way to meet you, and there are 400 men with him.” <span id="chapter32_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>And Jacob became very frightened and anxious. So he divided the people <span id="page85" class="pageNum" data-no="85" data-before-text="85"></span>who were with him, as well as the flocks, the cattle, and the camels, into two camps. <span id="chapter32_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>He said: “If Eʹsau attacks the one camp, then the other camp will be able to escape.”</p>
<p id="p273" data-pid="273" class="p273 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>After that Jacob said: “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, you who are saying to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives, and I will deal well with you,’ <span id="chapter32_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>I am unworthy of all the loyal love and of all the faithfulness that you have shown toward your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I have become two camps. <span id="chapter32_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Save me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother Eʹsau, for I am afraid of him that he may come and attack me, as well as the mothers and their children. <span id="chapter32_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>And you have said: ‘I will certainly deal well with you, and I will make your offspring<span id="footnotesource247"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote247">*</a> like the grains of sand of the sea, which are too numerous to count.’”</p>
<p id="p274" data-pid="274" class="p274 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>And he spent the night there. Then he took some of his possessions as a gift for Eʹsau his brother: <span id="chapter32_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 female sheep, 20 rams, <span id="chapter32_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>30 camels nursing their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 full-grown male donkeys.</p>
<p id="p275" data-pid="275" class="p275 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>He handed them over to his servants, one drove after another, and he said to his servants: “Cross over ahead of me, and you are to set a space between one drove and the next.” <span id="chapter32_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>He also commanded the first one: “In case Eʹsau my brother should meet you and ask, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these ahead of you belong?’ <span id="chapter32_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>then you should say, ‘To your servant Jacob. It is a gift sent to my lord, to Eʹsau, and look! he himself is also behind us.’” <span id="chapter32_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>And he commanded also the second, the third, and all those following the droves: “According to this word, you are to speak to Eʹsau when you meet him. <span id="chapter32_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>And you should also say, ‘Here is your servant Jacob behind us.’” For he said to himself: ‘If I appease him by sending a gift ahead of me, then afterward when I see him, he may give me a kindly reception.’ <span id="chapter32_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>So the gift crossed over ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.</p>
<p id="p276" data-pid="276" class="p276 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Later during that night, he rose and took his two wives and his two female servants and his 11 young sons and crossed over the ford of Jabʹbok. <span id="chapter32_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>So he took them and brought them across the stream,<span id="footnotesource248"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote248">*</a> and he brought over everything else he had.</p>
<p id="p277" data-pid="277" class="p277 sb"><span id="pos130842"></span><span id="chapter32_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Finally Jacob was left by himself. Then a man began to wrestle with him until the dawn broke. <span id="chapter32_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>When he saw that he had not prevailed over him, he touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated during his wrestling with him. <span id="chapter32_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>After that he said: “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” To this he said: “I am not going to let you go until you bless me.” <span id="chapter32_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>So he said to him: “What is your name?” to which he said: “Jacob.” <span id="pos131319"></span><span id="chapter32_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Then he said: “Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel,<span id="footnotesource249"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote249">*</a> for you have contended with God and with men and you have at last prevailed.” <span id="chapter32_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>In turn Jacob inquired: “Tell me, please, your name.” However, he said: “Why is it that you ask my name?” With that he blessed <span id="page86" class="pageNum" data-no="86" data-before-text="86"></span>him there. <span id="chapter32_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>So Jacob named the place Pe·niʹel,<span id="footnotesource250"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote250">*</a> for he said, “I have seen God face-to-face, yet my life<span id="footnotesource251"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote251">*</a> was preserved.”</p>
<p id="p278" data-pid="278" class="p278 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>And the sun rose upon him as soon as he passed by Pe·nuʹel,<span id="footnotesource252"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote252">*</a> but he was limping because of his hip. <span id="chapter32_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>That is why to this day the sons of Israel are not accustomed to eat the thigh sinew,<span id="footnotesource253"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote253">*</a> which is on the socket of the hip joint, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip joint by the thigh sinew.</p>
