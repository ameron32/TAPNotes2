<p id="p352" data-pid="352" class="p352 sb"><span id="chapter40_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own interpretation. <span id="chapter40_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The next morning, when Joseph came in and saw them, they looked dejected. <span id="chapter40_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>So he asked the officers of Pharʹaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house: “Why are your faces gloomy today?” <span id="pos161935"></span><span id="chapter40_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>At this they said to him: “We each had a dream, but there is no interpreter with us.” Joseph said to them: “Do not interpretations belong to God? Relate it to me, please.”</p>
<p id="p353" data-pid="353" class="p353 sb"><span id="chapter40_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>So the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, saying to him: “In my dream, there was a vine before me. <span id="chapter40_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>And on the vine, there were three twigs, and as it was sprouting shoots, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. <span id="chapter40_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>And Pharʹaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them out into Pharʹaoh’s cup. After that I put the cup in Pharʹaoh’s hand.” <span id="chapter40_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Then Joseph said to him: “This is its interpretation: The three twigs are three days. <span id="chapter40_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Three days from now, Pharʹaoh will bring you out,<span id="footnotesource286"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote286">*</a> restoring you to your office, and you will put Pharʹaoh’s cup into his hand as you did before when you were his cupbearer. <span id="chapter40_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Nevertheless, you must remember me <span id="page96" class="pageNum" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>when things go well with you. Please show me loyal love and mention me to Pharʹaoh, in order to get me out of this place. <span id="chapter40_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>I was, in fact, kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I have not done anything here for which they should put me in prison.”<span id="footnotesource287"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote287">*</a></p>
<p id="p354" data-pid="354" class="p354 sb"><span id="chapter40_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>When the chief baker saw that Joseph had interpreted something good, he said to him: “I too was in my dream, and there were three baskets of white bread on my head, <span id="chapter40_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>and in the top basket, there were all sorts of baked goods for Pharʹaoh, and there were birds eating them out of the basket on top of my head.” <span id="chapter40_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Then Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days. <span id="chapter40_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Three days from now, Pharʹaoh will behead you<span id="footnotesource288"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote288">*</a> and will hang you on a stake, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.”</p>
<p id="p355" data-pid="355" class="p355 sb"><span id="pos163636"></span><span id="chapter40_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Now the third day was Pharʹaoh’s birthday, and he made a feast for all his servants, and he brought out<span id="footnotesource289"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote289">*</a> both the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his servants. <span id="chapter40_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>And he returned the chief cupbearer to his post of cupbearer, and he continued to hand the cup to Pharʹaoh. <span id="chapter40_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them. <span id="chapter40_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>However, the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he kept forgetting him.</p>
