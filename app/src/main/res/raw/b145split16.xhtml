You are looking for Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ who was executed on the stake. He was raised up. He is not here. Look, here is the place where they laid him. <span id="chapter16_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galʹi·lee. You will see him there, just as he told you.’” <span id="chapter16_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>So when they came out, they fled from the tomb, trembling and overwhelmed with emotion. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were in fear.<span id="footnotesource115"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote115">*</a></p>
