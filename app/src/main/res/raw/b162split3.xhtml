We are His house if, indeed, <span id="page1603" class="pageNum" data-no="1603" data-before-text="1603"></span>we hold on firmly to our freeness of speech and the hope of which we boast down to the end.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="p11 sb"><span id="pos5586"></span><span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Therefore, just as the holy spirit says, “Today if you listen to his voice, <span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger, as in the day of testing in the wilderness, <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>where your forefathers put me to the test and tried me, despite seeing my works for 40 years. <span id="chapter3_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>This is why I became disgusted with this generation and said: ‘They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not come to know my ways.’ <span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>So I swore in my anger: ‘They will not enter into my rest.’”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="p12 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of you a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God; <span id="chapter3_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>but keep on encouraging one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin. <span id="chapter3_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>For we actually become partakers of<span id="footnotesource15"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote15">*</a> the Christ only if we hold firmly down to the end the confidence we had at the beginning. <span id="pos6548"></span><span id="chapter3_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>As it is said, “Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="p13 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>For who heard and yet provoked him to bitter anger? Was it not, in fact, all those who went out of Egypt under Moses? <span id="chapter3_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Moreover, with whom did God become disgusted for 40 years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? <span id="chapter3_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>And to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest? Was it not to those who acted disobediently? <span id="chapter3_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>So we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith.</p>
