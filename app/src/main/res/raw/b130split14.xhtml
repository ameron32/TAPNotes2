Should I let them inquire of me? <span id="chapter14_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Now speak with them and tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “If an Israelite is determined to follow his disgusting idols and sets up a stumbling block causing people to sin and he then comes to inquire of a prophet, I, Jehovah, will answer him appropriately according to his many disgusting idols. <span id="chapter14_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>For I will cause terror in the hearts of the house of Israel<span id="footnotesource85"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote85">*</a> because they have all withdrawn from me and have gone after their disgusting idols.”’</p>
<p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="p97 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>“So tell the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Come back and turn away from your disgusting idols and turn your faces away from all your detestable practices. <span id="chapter14_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>For if any Israelite or foreign resident living in Israel separates himself from me and is determined to follow his disgusting idols and sets up a stumbling block that causes people to sin and then comes to inquire of my prophet, I, Jehovah, I will personally answer him. <span id="chapter14_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>I will set my face against that man and make him a warning sign and a proverbial saying, and I will cut him off from my people; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.”’</p>
<p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="p98 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>“‘But if the prophet is fooled and gives a response, it is I, Jehovah, who have fooled that prophet. I will then stretch out my hand against him and annihilate him from my people Israel. <span id="chapter14_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>They will have to bear their guilt; the guilt of the inquirer will be the same as the guilt of the prophet, <span id="chapter14_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>so that the house of Israel may stop wandering away from me and stop defiling themselves by all their transgressions. And they will be my people, and I will be their God,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="p99 sb"><span id="pos46840"></span><span id="chapter14_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: <span id="chapter14_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>“Son of man, if a land sins against me by acting unfaithfully, I will stretch out my hand against it and destroy its food supply,<span id="footnotesource86"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote86">*</a> and I will send famine upon it and cut off man and animal from it.” <span id="pos47105"></span><span id="chapter14_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>“‘Even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were within it, they would be able to save only themselves<span id="footnotesource87"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote87">*</a> because of their righteousness,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</p>

<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="p103 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘So it will be when I send my four punishments<span id="footnotesource90"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote90">*</a>—sword, famine, vicious wild animal, and pestilence—against Jerusalem to cut off man and animal from it. <span id="chapter14_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>However, some left in it will escape and be brought out, both sons and daughters.
