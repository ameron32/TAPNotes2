<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="p70 sb"><span id="pos41318"></span><span id="chapter8"></span><span id="chapter8_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>8 </strong></span>At that time Solʹo·mon congregated the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, the chieftains of the paternal houses of Israel. They came to King Solʹo·mon at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the City of David, that is, Zion. <span id="chapter8_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>All the men of Israel assembled before King Solʹo·mon at the festival<span id="footnotesource92"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote92">*</a> in the month of Ethʹa·nim,<span id="footnotesource93"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote93">*</a> that is, the seventh month. <span id="chapter8_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>So all the elders of Israel came, and the priests lifted up the Ark. <span id="chapter8_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>They brought up the Ark of Jehovah, the tent of meeting, and all the holy utensils that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up. <span id="chapter8_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>King Solʹo·mon and the entire assembly of Israel, who had been summoned to meet with him, were before the Ark. So many sheep and cattle were being sacrificed that they could not be counted or numbered.</p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="p71 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the innermost room of the house, the Most Holy, underneath the wings of the cherubs.</p>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="p72 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Thus the wings of the cherubs were spread out over the place of the Ark, so that the cherubs overshadowed the Ark and its poles. <span id="chapter8_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The poles were so long that the tips of the poles were visible from the Holy in front of the innermost room, but they were not visible from outside. And they are there to this day. <span id="chapter8_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>There was nothing in the Ark but the two stone tablets that Moses placed there at Hoʹreb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the people of Israel while they were coming out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="p73 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>When the priests came out from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of Jehovah. <span id="chapter8_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The priests were not able to stand to minister because of <span id="page494" class="pageNum" data-no="494" data-before-text="494"></span>the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah. <span id="chapter8_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>At that time Solʹo·mon said: “Jehovah said he would reside in the thick gloom. <span id="chapter8_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>I have successfully built a lofty house for you, an established place for you to dwell in forever.”</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="p74 sb"><span id="pos43270"></span><span id="chapter8_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Then the king turned around and began to bless all the congregation of Israel while all the congregation of Israel stood. <span id="chapter8_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>He said: “May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, the one who by his own mouth promised my father David, and by his own hand has given fulfillment, saying, <span id="chapter8_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>‘From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house for my name to remain there, but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ <span id="chapter8_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>And it was the heart’s desire of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel. <span id="chapter8_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>But Jehovah said to my father David, ‘It was your heart’s desire to build a house for my name, and you did well to desire this in your heart. <span id="chapter8_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>However, you will not build the house, but your own son who is to be born to you<span id="footnotesource94"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote94">*</a> is the one who will build the house for my name.’ <span id="chapter8_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Jehovah has carried out the promise that he made, for I have succeeded my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as Jehovah promised. I have also built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel <span id="chapter8_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>and have set up a place there for the Ark containing the covenant that Jehovah made with our forefathers when he was bringing them out of the land of Egypt.”</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="p75 sb"><span id="pos44591"></span><span id="chapter8_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Then Solʹo·mon stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the congregation of Israel, and he spread his hands out to the heavens, <span id="chapter8_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>and he said: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and showing loyal love to your servants who are walking before you with all their heart. <span id="chapter8_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>You have kept the promise that you made to your servant David my father. You made the promise with your own mouth, and this day you have fulfilled it with your own hand. <span id="chapter8_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, keep the promise you made to your servant David my father when you said: ‘There will never fail to be a man of your line before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons will pay attention to their way by walking before me, just as you have walked before me.’ <span id="chapter8_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>And now, O God of Israel, let the promise that you made to your servant David my father prove trustworthy, please.</p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="p85 sb"><span id="pos52125"></span><span id="chapter8_verse62"></span><strong><sup>62 </sup></strong>Now the king and all Israel with him offered a grand sacrifice before Jehovah. <span id="chapter8_verse63"></span><strong><sup>63 </sup></strong>Solʹo·mon offered the communion sacrifices to Jehovah: He offered 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep.
