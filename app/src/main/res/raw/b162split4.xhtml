<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="p14 sb"><span id="pos7143"></span><span id="chapter4"></span><span id="chapter4_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>4 </strong></span>Therefore, since a promise of entering into his rest remains, let us be on guard<span id="footnotesource16"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote16">*</a> for fear someone among you seems to fall short of it. <span id="chapter4_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>For we have also had the good news declared to us, just as they had; but the word that they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. <span id="chapter4_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>For we who have exercised faith do enter into the rest, just as he has said: “So I swore in my anger, ‘They will not enter into my rest,’” although his works were finished from the founding of the world. <span id="chapter4_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>For in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,” <span id="chapter4_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>and here again he says: “They will not enter into my rest.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="p15 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Therefore, since it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience, <span id="chapter4_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>he again marks off a certain day by saying long afterward in David’s psalm, “Today”; just as it has been said above, “Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts.” <span id="chapter4_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>For if Joshua had led them into a place of rest, God would not afterward have spoken of another day. <span id="chapter4_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>So there remains a sabbath-rest for the people of God. <span id="chapter4_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>For the man who has entered into God’s rest has also rested from his own works, just as God did from his own.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="p16 sb"><span id="pos8485"></span><span id="chapter4_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same pattern of disobedience. <span id="pos8612"></span><span id="chapter4_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>For the word of God is alive and exerts power and <span id="page1604" class="pageNum" data-no="1604" data-before-text="1604"></span>is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul<span id="footnotesource17"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote17">*</a> and spirit,<span id="footnotesource18"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote18">*</a> and of joints from the marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart. <span id="chapter4_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>And there is not a creation that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="p17 sb"><span id="pos9027"></span><span id="chapter4_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold on to our public declaration of him. <span id="chapter4_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tested in all respects as we have, but without sin. <span id="chapter4_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Let us, then, approach the throne of undeserved kindness with freeness of speech, so that we may receive mercy and find undeserved kindness to help us at the right time.</p>
