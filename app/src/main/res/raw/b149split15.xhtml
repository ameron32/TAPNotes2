<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="p78 sb"><span id="pos50707"></span><span id="chapter15"></span><span id="chapter15_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>15 </strong></span>We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves. <span id="chapter15_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. <span id="chapter15_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>For even the Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written: “The reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me.” <span id="chapter15_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>For all the things that were <span id="page1523" class="pageNum" data-no="1523" data-before-text="1523"></span>written beforehand were written for our instruction, so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope. <span id="chapter15_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant you to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had, <span id="chapter15_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>so that unitedly you may with one voice<span id="footnotesource93"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote93">*</a> glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="p79 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>So welcome<span id="footnotesource94"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote94">*</a> one another, just as the Christ also welcomed you, with glory to God in view. <span id="chapter15_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>For I tell you that Christ became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God’s truthfulness, so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers, <span id="chapter15_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>and that the nations might glorify God for his mercy. Just as it is written: “That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations, and to your name I will sing praises.” <span id="chapter15_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>And again he says: “Be glad, you nations, with his people.” <span id="chapter15_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>And again: “Praise Jehovah,<span id="footnotesource95"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote95">*</a> all you nations, and let all the peoples praise him.” <span id="chapter15_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>And again Isaiah says: “There will be the root of Jesʹse, the one arising to rule nations; on him nations will rest their hope.” <span id="chapter15_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>May the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace by your trusting in him, so that you may abound<span id="footnotesource96"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote96">*</a> in hope with power of holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="p80 sb"><span id="pos52361"></span><span id="chapter15_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Now I myself am convinced about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are also full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and that you are able to admonish<span id="footnotesource97"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote97">*</a> one another. <span id="chapter15_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>However, I have written to you more outspokenly on some points, so as to give you another reminder, because of the undeserved kindness given to me from God <span id="chapter15_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>for me to be a public servant of Christ Jesus to the nations. I am engaging in the holy work of the good news of God, so that these nations might be an acceptable offering, sanctified with holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="p81 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>So I have reason to exult in Christ Jesus over the things pertaining to God. <span id="chapter15_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>For I will not presume to speak about anything except what Christ has done through me in order for the nations to be obedient, by my word and deed, <span id="chapter15_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>with the power of signs and wonders,<span id="footnotesource98"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote98">*</a> with the power of God’s spirit, so that from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Il·lyrʹi·cum I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ. <span id="chapter15_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>In this way, indeed, I made it my aim not to declare the good news where the name of Christ had already been made known, so as not to build on another man’s foundation; <span id="chapter15_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>but just as it is written: “Those who received no report about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="p82 sb"><span id="pos53659"></span><span id="chapter15_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>This is also why I was many times hindered from coming to you. <span id="chapter15_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>But now I no longer have untouched territory in these regions, and for many<span id="footnotesource99"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote99">*</a> years I have longed to come to you. <span id="chapter15_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Therefore, when I journey to Spain, I hope that I will see you and be accompanied partway there by you after I have first enjoyed your company for a time. <span id="chapter15_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>But now I am about to travel to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones. <span id="chapter15_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>For those in Mac·e·doʹni·a and A·chaʹia have been pleased to share their things by a contribution to the poor among the holy ones in Jerusalem. <span id="chapter15_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>True, they have been <span id="page1524" class="pageNum" data-no="1524" data-before-text="1524"></span>pleased to do so, and indeed they were debtors to them; for if the nations have shared in their spiritual things, they also owe it to minister to them with their material things. <span id="chapter15_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>So after I have finished with this and have delivered this contribution<span id="footnotesource100"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote100">*</a> securely to them, I will depart by way of you for Spain. <span id="chapter15_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Moreover, I know that when I do come to you, I will come with a full measure of blessing from Christ.</p>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="p83 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>Now I urge you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the spirit, that you exert yourselves with me in prayers to God for me, <span id="chapter15_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Ju·deʹa and that my ministry in behalf of Jerusalem may prove to be acceptable to the holy ones, <span id="chapter15_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>so that by God’s will I will come to you with joy and be refreshed together with you. <span id="chapter15_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>May the God who gives peace be with all of you. Amen.</p>
