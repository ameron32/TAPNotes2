<p id="p116" data-pid="116" class="p116 sb">“O Jehovah the true God, the great and awe-inspiring One, who keeps his covenant and shows loyal love to those who love him and keep his commandments, <span id="chapter9_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled; and we have deviated from your commandments and your judgments. <span id="chapter9_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, our forefathers, and all the people of the land. <span id="chapter9_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>To you, O Jehovah, belongs righteousness, but to us belongs shame<span id="footnotesource88"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote88">*</a> as is the case today, to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, those nearby and far away, in all the lands to which you dispersed them because they acted unfaithfully toward you.</p>
