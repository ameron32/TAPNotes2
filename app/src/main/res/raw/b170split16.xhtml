And a hurtful and malignant ulcer afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast and who were worshipping its image.</p>

And it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living creature<span id="footnotesource77"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote77">*</a> died, yes, the things in the sea.</p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="p101 sb"><span id="pos43110"></span><span id="chapter16_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs<span id="footnotesource78"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote78">*</a> of water. And they became blood. <span id="chapter16_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>I heard the angel over the waters say: “You, the One who is and who was, the loyal One, are righteous, for you have issued these judgments, <span id="chapter16_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; they deserve it.” <span id="chapter16_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>And I heard the altar say: “Yes, Jehovah<span id="footnotesource79"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote79">*</a> God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.”<span id="footnotesource80"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote80">*</a></p>

<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="p103 sb"><span id="pos43891"></span><span id="chapter16_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>The fifth one poured out his bowl on the throne of the wild beast. And its kingdom became darkened, and they began to gnaw their tongues because of their pain, <span id="chapter16_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>but they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works.</p>
<p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="p104 sb"><span id="pos44184"></span><span id="chapter16_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The sixth one poured out his bowl on the great river Eu·phraʹtes, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the rising of the sun.<span id="footnotesource81"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote81">*</a></p>
<p id="p105" data-pid="105" class="p105 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>And I saw three unclean inspired expressions<span id="footnotesource82"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote82">*</a> that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. <span id="pos44544"></span><span id="chapter16_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and they perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.</p>
