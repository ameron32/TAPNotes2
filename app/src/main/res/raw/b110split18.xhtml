Then they should return to me. <span id="chapter18_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>They must apportion it among themselves into seven shares. Judah will remain in his territory to the south, and the house of Joseph will remain in their territory to the north. <span id="chapter18_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>As for you, map out the land into seven shares, and bring them here to me, and I will cast lots here for you before Jehovah our God. <span id="page348" class="pageNum" data-no="348" data-before-text="348"></span><span id="chapter18_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>But the Levites have no share among you, because the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance; and Gad, Reuʹben, and the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh have already taken their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.”</p>

After that they returned to Joshua at the camp in Shiʹloh. <span id="chapter18_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiʹloh before Jehovah.
