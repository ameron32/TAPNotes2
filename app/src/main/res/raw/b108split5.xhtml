<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="p63 sb"><span id="pos24742"></span><span id="chapter5_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah continued speaking to Moses, saying: <span id="chapter5_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>“Tell the Israelites, ‘If a man or a woman commits any of the sins of mankind and acts unfaithfully toward Jehovah, that person<span id="footnotesource32"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote32">*</a> has become guilty. <span id="chapter5_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>He<span id="footnotesource33"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote33">*</a> must confess the sin that he has<span id="footnotesource34"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote34">*</a> committed and return the full amount as compensation for his guilt and also add a fifth of its value; he is to give it to the one he wronged. <span id="chapter5_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>But if the victim does not have a close relative to receive the compensation, it should be returned to Jehovah and will belong to the priest, apart from the ram of atonement with which he will make atonement for him.</p>

Whatever each one gives to the priest, that will belong to the priest.’”</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="p65 sb"><span id="pos25590"></span><span id="chapter5_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah went on to speak to Moses, saying: <span id="chapter5_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘This is what should be done if a man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him <span id="chapter5_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>and another man has sexual relations with her, but it was unknown to her husband and remains undiscovered, so that she has defiled herself but there is no witness against her and she has not been caught: <span id="chapter5_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Whether the husband becomes jealous and suspicious of his wife’s faithfulness when she has defiled herself, or whether he is jealous and suspicious of his wife’s faithfulness when she has not defiled herself, <span id="chapter5_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>the man must bring his wife to the priest, along with an offering for her, a tenth of an eʹphah<span id="footnotesource35"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote35">*</a> of barley flour. He must not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering bringing guilt to mind.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="p66 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>“‘The priest will bring her forward and make her stand before Jehovah. <span id="chapter5_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>The priest will take holy water in an earthenware vessel, and the priest will take some of the dust from the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water. <span id="chapter5_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>And the priest will make the woman stand before Jehovah and unbind the woman’s hair and put in her palms the grain offering for a reminder, that is, the grain offering of jealousy, and the priest will have in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse.</p>
