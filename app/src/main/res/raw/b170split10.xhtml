And when he cried out, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="p61 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, but I heard a voice out of heaven say: “Seal up the things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them down.” <span id="chapter10_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven, <span id="pos27469"></span><span id="chapter10_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>and he swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it: “There will be no delay any longer. <span id="pos27676"></span><span id="chapter10_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>But in the days when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet, the sacred secret that God declared as good news to his own slaves the prophets is indeed brought to a finish.”</p>
