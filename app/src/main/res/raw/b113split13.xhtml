He sent the rest of the people away, each one to his tent. <span id="chapter13_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Then Jonʹa·than struck down the garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines that was in Geʹba, and the Phi·lisʹtines heard about it. And Saul had the horn blown throughout all the land, saying: “Let the Hebrews hear!” <span id="chapter13_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>All Israel heard the news: “Saul has struck down a garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines, and now Israel has become a stench among the Phi·lisʹtines.” So the people were summoned to follow Saul at Gilʹgal.</p>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="p83 sb"><span id="pos46609"></span><span id="chapter13_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The Phi·lisʹtines also gathered together to fight against Israel, with 30,000 war chariots and 6,000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore; and they went up and camped in Michʹmash to the east of Beth-aʹven. <span id="chapter13_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>And the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, because they were hard-pressed; so the people hid in the caves, the hollows, <span id="page413" class="pageNum" data-no="413" data-before-text="413"></span>the crags, the cellars,<span id="footnotesource68"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote68">*</a> and the cisterns. <span id="chapter13_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Some of the Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilʹe·ad. But Saul was still in Gilʹgal, and all the people following him were trembling. <span id="chapter13_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>He continued waiting for seven days until the designated<span id="footnotesource69"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote69">*</a> time that Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilʹgal, and the people were scattering from him. <span id="chapter13_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Finally Saul said: “Bring to me the burnt sacrifice and the communion sacrifices.” And he offered up the burnt sacrifice.</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="p84 sb"><span id="pos47486"></span><span id="chapter13_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>But as soon as he had finished offering up the burnt sacrifice, Samuel arrived. So Saul went out to meet him and bless him. <span id="chapter13_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Then Samuel said: “What have you done?” Saul replied: “I saw that the people were deserting me, and you did not come within the designated time, and the Phi·lisʹtines were gathering together at Michʹmash. <span id="chapter13_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>So I said to myself, ‘Now the Phi·lisʹtines will come down against me at Gilʹgal, and I have not sought the favor<span id="footnotesource70"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote70">*</a> of Jehovah.’ So I felt obligated to offer up the burnt sacrifice.”</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="p85 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>At this Samuel said to Saul: “You have acted foolishly. You have not obeyed the commandment that Jehovah your God gave you. If you had, Jehovah would have made your kingdom firm over Israel forever. <span id="chapter13_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But now your kingdom will not last. Jehovah will find a man agreeable to his heart, and Jehovah will commission him as a leader over his people, because you did not obey what Jehovah commanded you.”</p>
<p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="p86 sb"><span id="pos48430"></span><span id="chapter13_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Then Samuel rose and went his way up from Gilʹgal to Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin, and Saul took the count of the people; those still with him were about 600 men. <span id="chapter13_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Saul, his son Jonʹa·than, and the people still with them were dwelling in Geʹba of Benjamin, and the Phi·lisʹtines had encamped at Michʹmash. <span id="chapter13_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>And the raiding parties would go out from the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines in three bands. One band would turn toward the road to Ophʹrah, to the land of Shuʹal; <span id="chapter13_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>another band would turn toward the road of Beth-hoʹron; and the third band would turn toward the road leading to the boundary that overlooks the valley of Ze·boʹim, toward the wilderness.</p>
<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="p87 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Now there was not a metalworker to be found in all the land of Israel, because the Phi·lisʹtines had said: “So that the Hebrews may not make a sword or a spear.” <span id="chapter13_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>And all the Israelites had to go down to the Phi·lisʹtines to get their plowshares, mattocks, axes, or sickles sharpened. <span id="chapter13_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>The price for sharpening was a pim<span id="footnotesource71"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote71">*</a> for the plowshares, for the mattocks, for the three-toothed instruments, for the axes, and for fixing fast the oxgoad. <span id="chapter13_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>And on the day of battle, not a sword or a spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonʹa·than; only Saul and his son Jonʹa·than had weapons.</p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="p88 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Now a garrison<span id="footnotesource72"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote72">*</a> of the Phi·lisʹtines had gone out to the ravine pass of Michʹmash.</p>
