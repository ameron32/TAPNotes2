<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="p4 sb"><span id="pos487"></span><span id="chapter1_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Beloved one, you show your faithfulness in what you do for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you. <span id="chapter1_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>They have given a witness about your love before the congregation. Please send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. <span id="chapter1_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>For it was in behalf of his name that they went out, not taking anything from the people of the nations. <span id="chapter1_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>So we are under obligation to show hospitality to such ones, so that we may become fellow workers in the truth.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="p6 sb"><span id="pos1411"></span><span id="chapter1_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Beloved one, do not imitate what is bad, but imitate what is good. The one who does good originates with God. The one who does bad has not seen God. <span id="chapter1_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>De·meʹtri·us has been well-reported-on by them all and by the truth itself. In fact, we too are bearing witness about him, and you know that the witness we give is true.</p>
