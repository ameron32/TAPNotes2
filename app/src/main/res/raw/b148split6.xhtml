<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="p35 sb"><span id="chapter6_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Consequently, the word of God continued to spread, and the number of the disciples kept multiplying very much in Jerusalem; and a large crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="p37 sb"><span id="chapter6_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>And as all those sitting in the Sanʹhe·drin stared at him, they saw that his face was like an angel’s face.</p>
