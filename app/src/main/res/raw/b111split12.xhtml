We will burn your house down with you in it.” <span id="chapter12_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>But Jephʹthah said to them: “Along with my people, I was engaged in a great conflict with the Amʹmon·ites. I did call to you for help, but you did not save me from their hand. <span id="chapter12_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>When I saw that you would not save me, then I decided to risk my life<span id="footnotesource100"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote100">*</a> and go against the Amʹmon·ites, and Jehovah handed them over to me. So why have you come today to fight against me?”</p>
<p id="p150" data-pid="150" class="p150 sb"><span id="chapter12_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jephʹthah then gathered all the men of Gilʹe·ad, and they fought Eʹphra·im; the men of Gilʹe·ad defeated Eʹphra·im, who had said: “You are only fugitives from Eʹphra·im, you Gilʹe·ad·ites in Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh.” <span id="chapter12_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Gilʹe·ad captured the fords of the Jordan ahead of Eʹphra·im; and when the men of Eʹphra·im <span id="page378" class="pageNum" data-no="378" data-before-text="378"></span>were trying to escape, they would say, “Let me cross over”; then the men of Gilʹe·ad would ask each one, “Are you an Eʹphra·im·ite?” When he would reply, “No!” <span id="pos58223"></span><span id="chapter12_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>they would say to him, “Please say Shibʹbo·leth.” But he would say, “Sibʹbo·leth,” as he was unable to say the word correctly. Then they would seize him and slay him at the fords of the Jordan. So 42,000 Eʹphra·im·ites fell at that time.</p>
<p id="p151" data-pid="151" class="p151 sb"><span id="chapter12_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jephʹthah judged Israel for six years, after which Jephʹthah the Gilʹe·ad·ite died and was buried in his city in Gilʹe·ad.</p>
