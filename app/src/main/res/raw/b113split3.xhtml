<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="p32 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>One day Eʹli was lying down in his usual place, and his eyes had grown dim; he was not able to see. <span id="chapter3_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The lamp of God had not yet been extinguished, and Samuel was lying in the temple<span id="footnotesource33"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote33">*</a> of Jehovah, where the Ark of God was. <span id="chapter3_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah then called Samuel. He answered: “Here I am.” <span id="chapter3_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>He ran to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said: “I did not call. Lie down again.” So he went and lay down. <span id="chapter3_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah called once again: “Samuel!” At this Samuel got up and went to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said: “I did not call, my son. Lie down again.” <span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>(Now Samuel had not yet come to know Jehovah, and the word of Jehovah had not yet been revealed to him.) <span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>So Jehovah called again, a third time: “Samuel!” At that he got up and went to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.”</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="p33 sb">Eʹli then realized that it was Jehovah who was calling the boy. <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>So Eʹli said to Samuel: “Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you should say, ‘Speak, Jehovah, for your servant is listening.’” And Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="p34 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah came and stood there, and he called as at the other times: “Samuel, Samuel!” At this Samuel said: “Speak, for your servant is listening.” <span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah said to Samuel: “Look! I am doing something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears about it tingle. <span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>On that day I will carry out toward Eʹli all that I said <span id="page402" class="pageNum" data-no="402" data-before-text="402"></span>about his house, from start to finish. <span id="chapter3_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>You must tell him that I am bringing a lasting judgment on his house for the error that he has known about, for his sons are cursing God, but he has not rebuked them. <span id="chapter3_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>That is why I have sworn to the house of Eʹli that the error of the house of Eʹli will never be atoned for by sacrifices or by offerings.”</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="p35 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of Jehovah’s house. Samuel was afraid to tell Eʹli of the vision. <span id="chapter3_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>But Eʹli called for Samuel: “Samuel, my son!” At this he said: “Here I am.” <span id="chapter3_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>He asked: “What message did he speak to you? Please, do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and add to it if you hide from me a single word of all that he said to you.” <span id="chapter3_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>So Samuel told him everything, and he did not hide anything from him. Eʹli said: “It is Jehovah. Let him do what is good in his eyes.”</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="p36 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Samuel continued growing up, and Jehovah himself was with him and did not let any of all his words go unfulfilled.<span id="footnotesource34"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote34">*</a> <span id="chapter3_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>All Israel from Dan to Beʹer-sheʹba became aware that Samuel had been confirmed as Jehovah’s prophet. <span id="chapter3_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>And Jehovah continued to appear in Shiʹloh, for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiʹloh by the word of Jehovah.</p>
