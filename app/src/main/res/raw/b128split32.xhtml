You say, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it, <span id="chapter32_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>and King Zed·e·kiʹah of Judah will not escape from the Chal·deʹans, for he will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak to him face-to-face and see him eye to eye.”’ <span id="chapter32_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>‘He will take Zed·e·kiʹah to Babylon, and there he will remain until I turn my attention to him,’ declares Jehovah. ‘Although you keep fighting against the Chal·deʹans, you will not succeed.’”</p>
<p id="p1016" data-pid="1016" class="p1016 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jeremiah said: “The word of Jehovah has come to me, saying, <span id="chapter32_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>‘Here Hanʹa·mel the son of Shalʹlum your uncle<span id="footnotesource280"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote280">*</a> will come to you and say: “Buy for yourself my field in Anʹa·thoth, because you have the first right to repurchase it.”’”</p>
<p id="p1017" data-pid="1017" class="p1017 sb"><span id="page1084" class="pageNum" data-no="1084" data-before-text="1084"></span><span id="chapter32_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Hanʹa·mel the son of my uncle came to me, just as Jehovah had said, into the Courtyard of the Guard, and he said to me: “Please buy my field in Anʹa·thoth, in the land of Benjamin, for you have the right to take possession of it and to repurchase it. Buy it for yourself.” At that I knew that this was by the word of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p1018" data-pid="1018" class="p1018 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>So I bought the field in Anʹa·thoth from Hanʹa·mel the son of my uncle. I weighed out the money to him, seven shekels<span id="footnotesource281"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote281">*</a> and ten silver pieces. <span id="chapter32_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Then I recorded it in a deed, affixed the seal, called in witnesses, and weighed the money in the scales. <span id="chapter32_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>I took the deed of purchase, the one that was sealed according to the commandment and legal requirements, as well as the one that was left unsealed, <span id="chapter32_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>and I gave the deed of purchase to Barʹuch son of Ne·riʹah son of Mah·seiʹah in the presence of Hanʹa·mel the son of my uncle, the witnesses who wrote in the deed of purchase, and all the Jews who were sitting in the Courtyard of the Guard.</p>
<p id="p1019" data-pid="1019" class="p1019 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>I now commanded Barʹuch in their presence, saying: <span id="chapter32_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Take these deeds, this deed of purchase, the sealed one and the other deed left unsealed, and put them into an earthenware vessel, so that they may be kept for a long time.’ <span id="chapter32_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.’”</p>
<p id="p1020" data-pid="1020" class="p1020 sb"><span id="pos138215"></span><span id="chapter32_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Then I prayed to Jehovah after giving the deed of purchase to Barʹuch the son of Ne·riʹah, saying: <span id="chapter32_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>“Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Look! You made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm.

<p id="p1021" data-pid="1021" class="p1021 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>“In time you gave them this land that you swore to give to their forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey. <span id="chapter32_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>And they came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did not do anything you commanded them to do, so that you caused all this calamity to befall them. <span id="chapter32_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Look! Men have come with siege ramparts to capture the city, and because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,<span id="footnotesource284"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote284">*</a> the city will certainly fall into the hands of the Chal·deʹans who are fighting against it; what you said has all happened, as you now see. <span id="chapter32_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>But you have told me, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘Buy for yourself the field with money and call in witnesses,’ although <span id="page1085" class="pageNum" data-no="1085" data-before-text="1085"></span>the city will certainly be given into the hand of the Chal·deʹans.”</p>
<p id="p1022" data-pid="1022" class="p1022 sb"><span id="pos140006"></span><span id="chapter32_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>At that the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying: <span id="chapter32_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>“Here I am, Jehovah, the God of all mankind.<span id="footnotesource285"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote285">*</a> Is there anything too wonderful for me? <span id="chapter32_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>So this is what Jehovah says, ‘Here I am handing this city over to the Chal·deʹans and into the hand of King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar<span id="footnotesource286"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote286">*</a> of Babylon, and he will capture it. <span id="chapter32_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>And the Chal·deʹans fighting against this city will come in and set this city on fire and burn it down along with the houses on whose roofs the people offered sacrifices to Baʹal and poured out drink offerings to other gods to offend me.’</p>
<p id="p1023" data-pid="1023" class="p1023 sb"><span id="chapter32_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>“‘For the people of Israel and of Judah have done only what was bad in my eyes, from their youth on; the people of Israel keep offending me by the work of their hands,’ declares Jehovah. <span id="chapter32_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>‘For this city, from the day that they built it down to this day, has been nothing but a cause of anger and wrath to me, so that it must be removed from before my face, <span id="chapter32_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>because of all the evil that the people of Israel and of Judah have done to offend me—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, and the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <span id="chapter32_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>They kept turning their backs to me, not their faces; although I tried to teach them again and again,<span id="footnotesource287"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote287">*</a> none of them would listen to receive discipline. <span id="chapter32_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>And they put their disgusting idols in the house that bears my name, in order to defile it. <span id="chapter32_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>Furthermore, they built the high places of Baʹal in the Valley of the Son of Hinʹnom,<span id="footnotesource288"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote288">*</a> in order to make their sons and their daughters pass through the fire to Moʹlech, something that I had not commanded them and that had never come into my heart<span id="footnotesource289"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote289">*</a> to do such a detestable thing, causing Judah to sin.’</p>
