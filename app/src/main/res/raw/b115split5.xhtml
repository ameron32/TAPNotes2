There is no one opposing me and nothing bad happening. <span id="chapter5_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>So I intend to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, just as Jehovah promised to David my father, saying: ‘Your son whom I will put on your throne in your place, he is the one who will build the house for my name.’ <span id="chapter5_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Now command your people to cut cedars of Lebʹa·non for me. My servants will work with your servants, and I will pay the wages of your servants according to the rate you set, for you are aware that not one of us knows how to cut trees like the Si·doʹni·ans.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="p42 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When Hiʹram heard Solʹo·mon’s words, he rejoiced greatly and said: “May Jehovah be praised today, for he has given David a wise son over this great<span id="footnotesource42"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote42">*</a> people!” <span id="chapter5_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>So Hiʹram sent word to Solʹo·mon: “I have heard the message you sent to me. I will do all you desire in providing the cedar and juniper timbers. <span id="chapter5_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>My servants will bring them down from Lebʹa·non to the sea, and I will make them into log rafts to go by sea to the place that you designate to me. I will have them broken up there, and you can carry them away. In exchange, you will provide the food that I request for my household.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="p43 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>So Hiʹram supplied all the timbers of cedar and juniper that Solʹo·mon desired. <span id="chapter5_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>And Solʹo·mon gave Hiʹram 20,000 cor measures<span id="footnotesource43"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote43">*</a> of wheat as food supplies for his household and 20 cor measures of very fine olive oil.<span id="footnotesource44"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote44">*</a> That was what Solʹo·mon gave Hiʹram year after year. <span id="chapter5_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>And Jehovah gave Solʹo·mon wisdom, just as He had promised him. And there was peace between Hiʹram and Solʹo·mon, and the two of them made a treaty.<span id="footnotesource45"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote45">*</a></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="p44 sb"><span id="pos27490"></span><span id="chapter5_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>King Solʹo·mon conscripted men for forced labor out of all Israel; 30,000 men were conscripted. <span id="chapter5_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>He would send them to Lebʹa·non in shifts of 10,000 each month. They would spend a month in Lebʹa·non and two months at their homes; and Ad·o·niʹram was over those conscripted for forced labor. <span id="chapter5_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Solʹo·mon had 70,000 common laborers<span id="footnotesource46"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote46">*</a> and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, <span id="chapter5_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>as well as Solʹo·mon’s 3,300 princely deputies who served as foremen to supervise the workmen. <span id="chapter5_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>At the king’s order, they quarried large stones, expensive stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones. <span id="chapter5_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>So Solʹo·mon’s <span id="page489" class="pageNum" data-no="489" data-before-text="489"></span>builders and Hiʹram’s builders and the Geʹbal·ites did the cutting, and they prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house.</p>
