However, he turned against him and rebelled. <span id="chapter24_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah began to send against him marauder bands of Chal·deʹans, Syrians, Moʹab·ites, and Amʹmon·ites. He kept sending them against Judah to destroy it, according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken through his servants the prophets. <span id="chapter24_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Surely it was by the order of Jehovah that this happened to Judah, to remove them from his sight because of all the sins that Ma·nasʹseh had committed, <span id="chapter24_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>and also the innocent blood that he had shed, for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood and Jehovah was not willing to forgive.</p>

<p id="p213" data-pid="213" class="p213 sb"><span id="chapter24_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Never again did the king of Egypt venture out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt, from the Wadi<span id="footnotesource196"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote196">*</a> of Egypt up to the Eu·phraʹtes River.</p>

His mother’s name was Ne·hushʹta the daughter of El·naʹthan of Jerusalem. <span id="chapter24_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that his father had done. <span id="pos121822"></span><span id="chapter24_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>During that time the servants of King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. <span id="chapter24_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon came to the city while his servants were laying siege to it.</p>

No one was left behind except the poorest people of the land. <span id="chapter24_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Thus he took Je·hoiʹa·chin into exile to Babylon; he also led away the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his court officials, and the foremost men of the land, taking them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. <span id="chapter24_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The king of Babylon also took into exile to Babylon all the warriors, 7,000, as well as 1,000 craftsmen and metalworkers,<span id="footnotesource199"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote199">*</a> all of them mighty men and trained for war. <span id="chapter24_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>The king of Babylon made Mat·ta·niʹah, Je·hoiʹa·chin’s uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zed·e·kiʹah.</p>
