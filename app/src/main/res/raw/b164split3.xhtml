<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="p16 sb"><span id="pos7243"></span><span id="chapter3"></span><span id="chapter3_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>3 </strong></span>In the same way, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands, so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, <span id="chapter3_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect. <span id="chapter3_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Do not let your adornment be external—the braiding of hair and the wearing of gold ornaments or fine clothing— <span id="chapter3_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God. <span id="chapter3_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>For this is how the holy women of the past who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their husbands, <span id="chapter3_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you have become her children, provided you continue doing good and do not give in to fear.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="p17 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>You husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge.<span id="footnotesource28"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote28">*</a> Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you of the undeserved favor of life, in order for your prayers not to be hindered.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="p18 sb"><span id="pos8328"></span><span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Finally, all of you have unity of mind,<span id="footnotesource29"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote29">*</a> fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion, and humility. <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Do not pay back injury for injury or insult for insult. Instead, repay with a blessing, for you were called to this course, so that you might inherit a blessing.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="p19 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>For “whoever would love life and see good days must guard his tongue from bad and his lips from speaking deception. <span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good; let him seek peace and pursue it. <span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>For the eyes of Jehovah<span id="footnotesource30"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote30">*</a> are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their supplication, but the face of Jehovah<span id="footnotesource31"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote31">*</a> is against those doing bad things.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="p20 sb"><span id="pos8998"></span><span id="chapter3_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Indeed, who will harm you if you become zealous for what <span id="page1624" class="pageNum" data-no="1624" data-before-text="1624"></span>is good? <span id="chapter3_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. However, do not fear what they fear,<span id="footnotesource32"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote32">*</a> nor be disturbed. <span id="pos9217"></span><span id="chapter3_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="p21 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Maintain a good conscience, so that in whatever way you are spoken against, those who speak against you may be put to shame because of your good conduct as followers of Christ. <span id="chapter3_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>For it is better to suffer because you are doing good, if it is God’s will to allow it, than because you are doing evil. <span id="chapter3_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>For Christ died once for all time for sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, in order to lead you to God. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit. <span id="chapter3_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>And in this state he went and preached to the spirits in prison, <span id="chapter3_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>who had formerly been disobedient when God was patiently waiting<span id="footnotesource33"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote33">*</a> in Noah’s day, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls,<span id="footnotesource34"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote34">*</a> were carried safely through the water.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="p22 sb"><span id="pos10212"></span><span id="chapter3_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Baptism, which corresponds to this, is also now saving you (not by the removing of the filth of the flesh, but by the request to God for a good conscience), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. <span id="chapter3_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>He is at God’s right hand, for he went to heaven, and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.</p>
