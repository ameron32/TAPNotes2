<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="p23 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Then the people of the land were continually discouraging<span id="footnotesource18"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote18">*</a> the people of Judah and disheartening them from building. <span id="chapter4_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>They hired advisers against them to frustrate their plans all the days of King Cyrus of Persia until the reign of King Da·riʹus of Persia. <span id="chapter4_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>At the beginning of the reign of A·has·u·eʹrus, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. <span id="pos11227"></span><span id="chapter4_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>And in the days of King Ar·ta·xerxʹes of Persia, Bishʹlam, Mithʹre·dath, Tabʹe·el, and the rest of his colleagues wrote to Ar·ta·xerxʹes the king; they translated the letter into Ar·a·maʹic, writing it with Ar·a·maʹic characters.<span id="footnotesource19"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote19">*</a></p>

They are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city, and they are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations. <span id="chapter4_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Now let it be known to the king that if this city should be rebuilt and its walls finished, they will not give tax, tribute, or toll, and it will result in a loss to the treasuries of the kings. <span id="chapter4_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Since we eat the salt of the palace<span id="footnotesource22"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote22">*</a> and it is not proper for us to see the king’s interests harmed, we have therefore sent to make this known to the king, <span id="chapter4_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>so that there may be an investigation of the book of records of your ancestors. You will find in the book of records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, injurious to kings and provinces,<span id="footnotesource23"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote23">*</a> and within it have been those stirring up sedition from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed. <span id="chapter4_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>We are making known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will have no control<span id="footnotesource24"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote24">*</a> of the region Beyond the River.”</p>
