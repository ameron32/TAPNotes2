<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="p9 sb"><span id="pos4545"></span><span id="chapter2"></span><span id="chapter2_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>2 </strong></span>Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are, if you judge; for when you judge another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge practice the same things. <span id="chapter2_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Now we know that God’s judgment is in harmony with truth, against those who practice such things.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="p10 sb"><span id="chapter2_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>But do you suppose, O man, that while you judge those who practice such things and yet you do them, you will escape the judgment of God? <span id="chapter2_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance<span id="footnotesource11"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> and patience, because you do not know that God in his kindness is trying to lead you to repentance? <span id="chapter2_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>But according to your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of the revealing of God’s righteous judgment. <span id="chapter2_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>And he will pay back to each one according to his works: <span id="chapter2_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>everlasting life to those who are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibleness by endurance in work that is good; <span id="chapter2_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>however, for those who are contentious and who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and anger. <span id="chapter2_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>There will be tribulation and distress on every person<span id="footnotesource12"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a> who works what is harmful, on the Jew first and also on the Greek; <span id="chapter2_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>but glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. <span id="chapter2_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>For there is no partiality with God.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="p11 sb"><span id="chapter2_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>For all those who sinned without law will also perish without law; but all those who sinned under law will be judged by law. <span id="chapter2_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>For the hearers of law are not the ones righteous before God, but the doers of law will be declared righteous. <span id="pos6156"></span><span id="chapter2_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>For when people of the nations, <span id="page1509" class="pageNum" data-no="1509" data-before-text="1509"></span>who do not have law, do by nature the things of the law, these people, although not having law, are a law to themselves. <span id="chapter2_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts, while their conscience is bearing witness with them, and by<span id="footnotesource13"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote13">*</a> their own thoughts they are being accused or even excused. <span id="chapter2_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>This will take place in the day when God through Christ Jesus judges the secret things of mankind, according to the good news I declare.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="p12 sb"><span id="pos6686"></span><span id="chapter2_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>If, now, you are a Jew in name and rely on law and take pride in God, <span id="chapter2_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>and you know his will and approve of things that are excellent because you are instructed<span id="footnotesource14"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote14">*</a> out of the Law, <span id="chapter2_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>and you are convinced that you are a guide of the blind, a light for those in darkness, <span id="chapter2_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>a corrector of the unreasonable ones, a teacher of young children, and having the framework of the knowledge and of the truth in the Law— <span id="chapter2_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not teach yourself? You, the one preaching, “Do not steal,” do you steal? <span id="chapter2_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>You, the one saying, “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You, the one abhorring idols, do you rob temples? <span id="chapter2_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>You who take pride in law, do you dishonor God by your transgressing of the Law? <span id="chapter2_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>For “the name of God is being blasphemed among the nations because of you,” just as it is written.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="p13 sb"><span id="pos7574"></span><span id="chapter2_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Circumcision is, in fact, of benefit only if you practice law; but if you are a transgressor of law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. <span id="chapter2_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>If, therefore, an uncircumcised person keeps the righteous requirements of the Law, his uncircumcision will be counted as circumcision, will it not? <span id="chapter2_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>And the physically uncircumcised person will, by carrying out the Law, judge you who are a transgressor of law despite having its written code and circumcision. <span id="chapter2_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision something on the outside, on the flesh. <span id="chapter2_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit and not by a written code. That person’s praise comes from God, not from people.</p>
