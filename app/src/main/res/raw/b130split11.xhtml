There at the entrance of the gate I saw 25 men, and among them were Ja·az·a·niʹah the son of Azʹzur and Pel·a·tiʹah the son of Be·naiʹah, princes of the people. <span id="page1144" class="pageNum" data-no="1144" data-before-text="1144"></span><span id="chapter11_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Then He said to me: “Son of man, these are the men who are scheming evil and giving wicked advice in<span id="footnotesource65"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote65">*</a> this city. <span id="pos32747"></span><span id="chapter11_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>They are saying, ‘Is it not the time for building houses? The city<span id="footnotesource66"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote66">*</a> is the cooking pot,<span id="footnotesource67"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote67">*</a> and we are the flesh.’</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="p73 sb"><span id="chapter11_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>“So prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.”</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="p74 sb"><span id="chapter11_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Then the spirit of Jehovah came upon me, and he said to me: “Say, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “What you have said is correct, O house of Israel, and I know what you are thinking.<span id="footnotesource68"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote68">*</a> <span id="chapter11_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>You have caused many to die in this city, and you have filled her streets with the dead.”’” <span id="chapter11_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘The dead bodies that you have strewn about the city are the flesh, and the city is the cooking pot. But you yourselves will be taken out of it.’”</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="p75 sb"><span id="chapter11_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>“‘A sword you have feared, and a sword I will bring against you,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. <span id="chapter11_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>‘I will bring you out of her and give you into the hand of foreigners and execute judgment on you. <span id="chapter11_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>You will fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah. <span id="chapter11_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The city will not be a cooking pot for you, and you will not be the flesh within it; I will judge you at the border of Israel, <span id="chapter11_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>and you will have to know that I am Jehovah. For you did not walk in my regulations and carry out my judgments, but you have acted in harmony with the judgments of the nations around you.’”</p>
<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="p76 sb"><span id="chapter11_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>As soon as I prophesied, Pel·a·tiʹah the son of Be·naiʹah died, and I fell facedown and cried with a loud voice: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Are you going to exterminate the remaining ones of Israel?”</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="p77 sb"><span id="pos34291"></span><span id="chapter11_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: <span id="chapter11_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>“Son of man, your brothers, those of your brothers with the right of repurchase, along with the entire house of Israel, have been told by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘Keep far away from Jehovah. The land is ours; it has been given to us as a possession.’ <span id="chapter11_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Therefore say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Although I have removed them far away among the nations and I have scattered them among the lands, for a little while I will become a sanctuary for them in the lands to which they have gone.”’</p>
