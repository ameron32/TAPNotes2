<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="p12 sb"><span id="pos5044"></span><span id="chapter3_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Now we are giving you instructions, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw from every brother who is walking disorderly and not according to the tradition<span id="footnotesource12"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a> that you<span id="footnotesource13"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote13">*</a> received from us. <span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>For you yourselves know how you should imitate us, because we did not behave in a disorderly way among you, <span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>nor did we eat anyone’s food free.<span id="footnotesource14"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote14">*</a> On the contrary, by labor and toil we were working night and day so as not to impose an expensive burden on any one of you. <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Not that we do not have authority, but we wanted to offer ourselves as an example for you to imitate. <span id="chapter3_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>In fact, when we were with you, we used to give you this order: “If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.” <span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>For we hear that some are walking disorderly among you, not working at all, but meddling with what does not concern them. <span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>To such people we give the order and exhortation in the Lord Jesus Christ that they should work quietly and eat food they themselves earn.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="p13 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>For your part, brothers, do not give up in doing good. <span id="chapter3_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter, keep this one marked and stop associating with him, so that he may become ashamed. <span id="chapter3_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>And yet do not consider him an enemy, but continue admonishing him as a brother.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="p14 sb"><span id="pos6352"></span><span id="chapter3_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace constantly in every way. May the Lord be with all of you.</p>
