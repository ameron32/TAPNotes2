Joʹab attacked Rabʹbah and tore it down. <span id="chapter20_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Then David took the crown of Malʹcam from its head, and found that it weighed a talent<span id="footnotesource129"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote129">*</a> of gold, and in it there were precious stones; and it was placed on David’s head. He also took a vast amount of spoil from the city. <span id="chapter20_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>And he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work at sawing stones and at working with sharp iron instruments and with axes. That was what David did to all the cities of the Amʹmon·ites. Finally David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.</p>

<p id="p195" data-pid="195" class="p195 sb"><span id="chapter20_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>And there was war again with the Phi·lisʹtines, and El·haʹnan the son of Jaʹir struck down Lahʹmi the brother of Go·liʹath the Gitʹtite, whose spear had a shaft like the beam of loom workers.</p>
<p id="p196" data-pid="196" class="p196 sb"><span id="chapter20_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>War broke out yet again at Gath, where there was a man of extraordinary size, with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot, 24 in all; and he too was a descendant of the Rephʹa·im. <span id="chapter20_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>He kept taunting Israel.
