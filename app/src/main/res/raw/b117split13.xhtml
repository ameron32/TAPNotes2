<p id="p130" data-pid="130" class="p130 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>So David became fearful of the true God on that day and said: “How can I bring the Ark of the true God to me?” <span id="chapter13_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>David did not bring the Ark to where he was in the City of David, but he had it taken to the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom the Gitʹtite. <span id="chapter13_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>The Ark of the true God was with the household of Oʹbed-eʹdom, remaining at his house for three months, and Jehovah kept blessing the household of Oʹbed-eʹdom and all he had.</p>
