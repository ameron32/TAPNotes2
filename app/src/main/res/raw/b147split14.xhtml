<p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="p102 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jesus said to him: “Even after I have been with you men for such a long time, Philip, have you not come to know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also. How is it you say, ‘Show us the Father’? <span id="chapter14_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me? The things I say to you I do not speak of my own originality, but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works. <span id="chapter14_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Believe me that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me; otherwise, believe because of the works themselves. <span id="chapter14_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Most truly I say to you, whoever exercises faith in me will also do the works that I do; and he will do works greater than these, because I am going my way to the Father. <span id="chapter14_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Also, whatever you ask in my name, I will do this, so that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son. <span id="chapter14_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.</p>

Do not let your hearts be troubled nor let them shrink out of fear. <span id="pos76026"></span><span id="chapter14_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>You heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I am. <span id="chapter14_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>So now I have told you before it occurs, so that you may believe when it does occur. <span id="chapter14_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>I will not speak with you much more, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has no hold on me.<span id="footnotesource76"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote76">*</a> <span id="chapter14_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>But for the world to know that I love the Father, I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do.
