The half of my belongings, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and whatever I extorted<span id="footnotesource177"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote177">*</a> from anyone, I am restoring four times over.” <span id="chapter19_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>At this Jesus said to him: “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. <span id="chapter19_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>For the Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost.”</p>
<p id="p169" data-pid="169" class="p169 sb"><span id="pos109941"></span><span id="chapter19_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>While they were listening to these things, he told another illustration, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the Kingdom of God was going to appear instantly. <span id="chapter19_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>So he said: “A man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return. <span id="chapter19_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Calling ten of his slaves, he gave them ten miʹnas<span id="footnotesource178"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote178">*</a> and told them, ‘Do business with these until I come.’ <span id="chapter19_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But his citizens hated him and sent out a body of ambassadors after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to become king over us.’</p>
<p id="p170" data-pid="170" class="p170 sb"><span id="chapter19_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>“When he eventually got back after having secured the kingly power,<span id="footnotesource179"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote179">*</a> he summoned the slaves to whom he had given the money,<span id="footnotesource180"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote180">*</a> in order to ascertain what they had gained by their business activity. <span id="chapter19_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>So the first one came forward and said, ‘Lord, your miʹna gained ten miʹnas.’ <span id="chapter19_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>He said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful, hold authority over ten cities.’ <span id="chapter19_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Now the second came, saying, ‘Your miʹna, Lord, made five miʹnas.’ <span id="chapter19_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>He said to this one as well, ‘You too be in charge of five cities.’ <span id="chapter19_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>But another one came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your miʹna that I kept hidden away in a cloth. <span id="chapter19_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>You see, I was in fear of you, because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.’ <span id="chapter19_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>He said to him, ‘By your own words I judge you, wicked slave. You knew, did you, that I am a harsh man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? <span id="chapter19_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>So why did you not put my money<span id="footnotesource181"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote181">*</a> in a bank? Then on my coming, I would have collected it with interest.’</p>
<p id="p171" data-pid="171" class="p171 sb"><span id="chapter19_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>“With that he said to those standing by, ‘Take the miʹna from him and give it to the one who has the ten miʹnas.’ <span id="chapter19_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>But they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten miʹnas!’— <span id="chapter19_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>‘I say to you, to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. <span id="chapter19_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Moreover, bring these enemies of mine here who did not want me to become king over them and execute them in front of me.’”</p>
<p id="p172" data-pid="172" class="p172 sb"><span id="pos112048"></span><span id="chapter19_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>After he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. <span id="chapter19_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>And when he got near to Bethʹpha·ge and Bethʹa·ny at the mountain called Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, <span id="chapter19_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>saying: “Go into the village that is within sight, and after you enter it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. <span id="chapter19_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>But if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you must say, ‘The Lord needs it.’” <span id="chapter19_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had said to them. <span id="chapter19_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>But as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them: <span id="page1414" class="pageNum" data-no="1414" data-before-text="1414"></span>“Why are you untying the colt?” <span id="chapter19_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>They said: “The Lord needs it.” <span id="chapter19_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>And they led it to Jesus, and they threw their outer garments on the colt and seated Jesus on it.</p>
<p id="p173" data-pid="173" class="p173 sb"><span id="chapter19_verse36"></span><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>As he moved along, they were spreading their outer garments on the road. <span id="chapter19_verse37"></span><strong><sup>37 </sup></strong>As soon as he got near the road down the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice because of all the powerful works they had seen, <span id="chapter19_verse38"></span><strong><sup>38 </sup></strong>saying: “Blessed is the one coming as the King in Jehovah’s<span id="footnotesource182"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote182">*</a> name! Peace in heaven, and glory in the heights above!” <span id="chapter19_verse39"></span><strong><sup>39 </sup></strong>However, some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.” <span id="chapter19_verse40"></span><strong><sup>40 </sup></strong>But in reply he said: “I tell you, if these remained silent, the stones would cry out.”</p>
<p id="p174" data-pid="174" class="p174 sb"><span id="pos113454"></span><span id="chapter19_verse41"></span><strong><sup>41 </sup></strong>And when he got nearby, he viewed the city and wept over it, <span id="chapter19_verse42"></span><strong><sup>42 </sup></strong>saying: “If you, even you, had discerned on this day the things having to do with peace—but now they have been hidden from your eyes. <span id="chapter19_verse43"></span><strong><sup>43 </sup></strong>Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed stakes and will encircle you and besiege<span id="footnotesource183"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote183">*</a> you from every side. <span id="chapter19_verse44"></span><strong><sup>44 </sup></strong>They will dash you and your children within you to the ground, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.”</p>
<p id="p175" data-pid="175" class="p175 sb"><span id="pos114026"></span><span id="chapter19_verse45"></span><strong><sup>45 </sup></strong>Then he entered the temple and started to throw out those who were selling, <span id="chapter19_verse46"></span><strong><sup>46 </sup></strong>saying to them: “It is written, ‘My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers.”</p>
<p id="p176" data-pid="176" class="p176 sb"><span id="chapter19_verse47"></span><strong><sup>47 </sup></strong>He continued teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal ones of the people were seeking to kill him; <span id="chapter19_verse48"></span><strong><sup>48 </sup></strong>but they did not find any way to do this, for the people one and all kept hanging on to him to hear him.</p>
