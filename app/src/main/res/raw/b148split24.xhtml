<p id="p170" data-pid="170" class="p170 sb"><span id="pos119067"></span><span id="chapter24"></span><span id="chapter24_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>24 </strong></span>Five days later the high priest An·a·niʹas came down with some elders and a public speaker<span id="footnotesource214"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote214">*</a> named Ter·tulʹlus, and they presented their case against Paul to the governor. <span id="chapter24_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>When he was called, Ter·tulʹlus started accusing him, saying:</p>
<p id="p171" data-pid="171" class="p171 sb">“Seeing that we enjoy great peace through you and that through your forethought reforms are taking place in this nation, <span id="chapter24_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>at all times and also in all places we acknowledge this, Your Excellency Felix, with the greatest thankfulness. <span id="chapter24_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>But that I may not detain you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly in your kindness. <span id="chapter24_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>For we have found this man to be a pest,<span id="footnotesource215"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote215">*</a> stirring up seditions among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth, and he is a spearhead of the sect of the Naz·a·renesʹ. <span id="chapter24_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>He also tried to profane the temple, so we seized him. <span id="chapter24_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><span id="footnotesource216"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote216">*</a> —— <span id="chapter24_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>When you examine him yourself, you will find out about all these things of which we are accusing him.”</p>
<p id="p172" data-pid="172" class="p172 sb"><span id="chapter24_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>With that the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were true. <span id="pos120081"></span><span id="chapter24_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>When the governor nodded to Paul to speak, he answered:</p>
<p id="p173" data-pid="173" class="p173 sb"><span id="page1499" class="pageNum" data-no="1499" data-before-text="1499"></span>“Knowing well that this nation has had you as judge for many years, I readily speak in my own defense. <span id="chapter24_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>As you can verify for yourself, it has not been more than 12 days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem; <span id="chapter24_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>and they found me neither arguing with anyone in the temple nor stirring up a mob, either in the synagogues or throughout the city. <span id="chapter24_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of right now. <span id="chapter24_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But I do admit this to you, that according to the way that they call a sect, in this manner I am rendering sacred service to the God of my forefathers, as I believe all the things set forth in the Law and written in the Prophets. <span id="chapter24_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>And I have hope toward God, which hope these men also look forward to, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. <span id="chapter24_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Because of this I always strive to maintain a clear<span id="footnotesource217"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote217">*</a> conscience before God and men. <span id="chapter24_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Now after quite a number of years, I arrived to bring gifts of mercy to my nation and to make offerings. <span id="chapter24_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>While I was caring for these matters, they found me ceremonially cleansed in the temple, but not with a crowd or causing a disturbance. But there were some Jews from the province of Asia <span id="chapter24_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>who ought to be present before you to accuse me if they actually have anything against me. <span id="chapter24_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Or let the men here say for themselves what wrong they found as I stood before the Sanʹhe·drin, <span id="chapter24_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>except for this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: ‘Over the resurrection of the dead I am today being judged before you!’”</p>
<p id="p174" data-pid="174" class="p174 sb"><span id="pos121741"></span><span id="chapter24_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>However, Felix, knowing quite well the facts concerning this Way, began to put them off and say: “Whenever Lysʹi·as the military commander comes down, I will decide these matters involving you.” <span id="chapter24_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>And he gave orders to the army officer that the man be kept under arrest but given some freedom, and that his people be allowed to attend to his needs.</p>
<p id="p175" data-pid="175" class="p175 sb"><span id="chapter24_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Some days later Felix came with Dru·silʹla his wife, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and listened to him speak about the belief in Christ Jesus. <span id="chapter24_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>But as Paul talked about righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and answered: “Go away for now, but when I have an opportunity I will send for you again.” <span id="chapter24_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>At the same time he was hoping that Paul would give him money. For that reason, he sent for him even more frequently and conversed with him. <span id="chapter24_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>But when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and because Felix desired to gain favor with the Jews, he left Paul in custody.</p>
