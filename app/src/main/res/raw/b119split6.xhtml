<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="p36 sb"><span id="chapter6_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>“In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued an order concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: ‘Let the house be rebuilt as the place where they are to offer sacrifices, and its foundations are to be set in place; its height is to be 60 cubits,<span id="footnotesource34"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote34">*</a> its width 60 cubits, <span id="chapter6_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>with three layers of large stones rolled into place and one layer of timbers; and let the expense be paid from the king’s house. <span id="chapter6_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Also, let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God that Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon be returned, so that they may be put in their place in the temple in Jerusalem and be deposited in the house of God.’</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="p37 sb"><span id="chapter6_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>“So now Tatʹte·nai the governor of the region Beyond the River,<span id="footnotesource35"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote35">*</a> Sheʹthar-bozʹe·nai, and your colleagues, the lesser governors of the region Beyond the River—stay away from there. <span id="chapter6_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Do not interfere with the work on that house of God. The governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews will rebuild that house of God in its former place. <span id="chapter6_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Furthermore, I am issuing an order as to what you are to do for these elders of the Jews for rebuilding that house of God: From the royal treasury, from the tax collected in the region Beyond the River, the expenses are to be promptly given to these men to continue without interruption. <span id="chapter6_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>And whatever is needed—young bulls as well as rams and lambs for the burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, just as the priests who are in Jerusalem say—is to be given them continually day by day without fail, <span id="chapter6_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>so that they may continually present offerings that please the God of the heavens and pray for the life of the king and his sons. <span id="chapter6_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>I have also issued an order that if anyone violates this decree, a timber will be pulled out of his house and he will be lifted up and fastened to it,<span id="footnotesource36"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote36">*</a> and his house will be turned into a public latrine<span id="footnotesource37"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote37">*</a> for this offense. <span id="chapter6_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>And may the God who has caused his name to reside there overthrow any king and people who lift a hand to violate this order and destroy that house of God, which is in Jerusalem.
