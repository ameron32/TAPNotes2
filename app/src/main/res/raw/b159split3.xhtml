<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="p14 sb"><span id="pos6745"></span><span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Now in the way that Janʹnes and Jamʹbres opposed Moses, so these also go on opposing the truth. Such men are completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith. <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Nevertheless, they will make no further progress, for their folly<span id="footnotesource16"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote16">*</a> will be very plain to all, as it was with those two men. <span id="chapter3_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>But you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, <span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>the persecutions and sufferings such as I experienced in Antioch, in I·coʹni·um, in Lysʹtra. I endured these persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from them all. <span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted. <span id="chapter3_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>But wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="p15 sb"><span id="pos7571"></span><span id="chapter3_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from whom you learned them <span id="chapter3_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>and that from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. <span id="pos7842"></span><span id="chapter3_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight,<span id="footnotesource17"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote17">*</a> for disciplining in righteousness, <span id="chapter3_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.</p>
