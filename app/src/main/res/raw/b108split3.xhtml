<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="p34 sb"><span id="pos10778"></span><span id="chapter3_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah then said to Moses: <span id="chapter3_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>“Bring the tribe of Leʹvi forward, and stand them before Aaron the priest, and they will minister to him. <span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>They are to fulfill their responsibilities toward him and toward all the assembly before the tent of meeting by carrying out their service in connection with the tabernacle. <span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>They are to take care of all the utensils of the tent of meeting and to carry out their responsibilities toward the Israelites by taking care of the services related to the tabernacle. <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>You are to give the Levites to Aaron and his sons.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="p35 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: <span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>“As for me, look!
