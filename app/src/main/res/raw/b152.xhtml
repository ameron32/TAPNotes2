<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="p2 sb"><span id="pos67"></span><span id="chapter1"></span><span id="chapter1_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>1 </strong></span>Paul, an apostle, neither from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him up from the dead, <span id="chapter1_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>and all the brothers with me, to the congregations of Ga·laʹti·a:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="p3 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <span id="chapter1_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>He gave himself for our sins so that he might rescue us from the present wicked system of things<span id="footnotesource1"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> according to the will of our God and Father, <span id="chapter1_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="p4 sb"><span id="pos568"></span><span id="chapter1_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away<span id="footnotesource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> from the One who called you with Christ’s undeserved kindness to another sort of good news. <span id="chapter1_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Not that there is another good news; but there are certain ones who are causing you trouble and wanting to distort the good news about the Christ. <span id="chapter1_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>However, even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond the good news we declared to you, let him be accursed. <span id="chapter1_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>As we have said before, I now say again, Whoever is declaring to you as good news something beyond what you accepted, let him be accursed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="p5 sb"><span id="pos1168"></span><span id="chapter1_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Is it, in fact, men I am now trying to persuade or God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be Christ’s slave. <span id="chapter1_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>For I want you to know, brothers, that the good news I declared to you is not of human origin; <span id="chapter1_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>for neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it was through a revelation by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="p6 sb"><span id="pos1541"></span><span id="chapter1_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Of course, you heard about my conduct formerly in Juʹda·ism, that I kept intensely<span id="footnotesource3"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it; <span id="chapter1_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>and I was making greater progress in Juʹda·ism than many of my own age in my nation, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers. <span id="chapter1_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>But when God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his undeserved kindness, thought good <span id="chapter1_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>to reveal his Son through me so that I might declare the good news about him to the nations, I did not immediately consult with any human;<span id="footnotesource4"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> <span id="chapter1_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before I was, but I went to Arabia, and then I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="p7 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to visit Ceʹphas,<span id="footnotesource5"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> and I stayed with him for 15 days. <span id="chapter1_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>But I did not see any of the other apostles, only James the brother of the Lord. <span id="chapter1_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Now regarding the things I am writing you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="p8 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>After that I went into the regions of Syria and Ci·liʹcia. <span id="chapter1_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>But I was personally unknown to the congregations of Ju·deʹa that were in union with Christ. <span id="chapter1_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>They only used to hear: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now declaring the good news about the faith that he formerly devastated.” <span id="chapter1_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>So they began glorifying God because of me.</p>
