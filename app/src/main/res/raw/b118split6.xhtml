<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="p28 sb"><span id="chapter6_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Then the king turned around and began to bless all the congregation of Israel while all the congregation of Israel stood. <span id="chapter6_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>He said: “May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, the one who by his own mouth promised my father David and by his own hands has given fulfillment, saying, <span id="chapter6_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>‘From the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house for my name to remain there, and I have not chosen a man to become leader over my people Israel. <span id="chapter6_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>But I have chosen Jerusalem for my name to remain there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ <span id="chapter6_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>And it was the heart’s desire of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel. <span id="chapter6_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>But Jehovah said to my father David, ‘It was your heart’s desire to build a house for my name, and you did well to desire this in your heart. <span id="chapter6_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>However, you will not build the house, but your own son who is to be born to you<span id="footnotesource36"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote36">*</a> is the one who will build the house for my name.’ <span id="chapter6_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah has carried out the promise that he made, for I have succeeded my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as Jehovah promised.
