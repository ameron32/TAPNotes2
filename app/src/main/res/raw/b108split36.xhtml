<p id="p400" data-pid="400" class="p400 sb"><span id="chapter36_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Then Moses commanded the Israelites at the order of Jehovah: “What the tribe of the sons of Joseph is saying is correct. <span id="chapter36_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>This is the word that Jehovah has commanded for the daughters of Ze·loʹphe·had: ‘They may marry whomever they wish. However, they should marry someone from a family of the tribe of their father. <span id="chapter36_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>No inheritance of the Israelites should circulate from tribe to tribe, for the Israelites should hold on to the inheritance of the tribe of their forefathers. <span id="chapter36_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>And every daughter who possesses an inheritance among the tribes of Israel should become a wife of a descendant of her father’s tribe, so that the Israelites may keep possession of the inheritance of their forefathers. <span id="chapter36_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>No inheritance should circulate from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of Israel should hold on to their own inheritance.’”</p>
<p id="p401" data-pid="401" class="p401 sb"><span id="chapter36_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>The daughters of Ze·loʹphe·had did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. <span id="chapter36_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>So Mahʹlah, Tirʹzah, Hogʹlah, Milʹcah, and Noah, the daughters of Ze·loʹphe·had, married the sons of their father’s brothers. <span id="chapter36_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>They became wives of men from the families of Ma·nasʹseh the son of Joseph so that their inheritance would remain in the tribe of their father’s family.</p>
<p id="p402" data-pid="402" class="p402 sb"><span id="chapter36_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>These are the commandments and the judicial decisions that Jehovah gave to the Israelites through Moses on the desert plains of Moʹab by the Jordan at Jerʹi·cho.</p>
