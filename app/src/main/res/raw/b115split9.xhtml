I have sanctified this house that you built by permanently putting my name there, and my eyes and my heart will always be there. <span id="chapter9_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>And you, if you walk before me as your father David walked, with integrity of heart and with uprightness, by doing everything I have commanded you, and you obey my regulations and my judgments, <span id="chapter9_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David, saying, ‘There will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of Israel.’ <span id="chapter9_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>But if you and your sons turn away from following me and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have put before you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, <span id="chapter9_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>I will cut Israel off from the surface of the land that I have given to them, and the house that I have sanctified for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel will become an object of scorn<span id="footnotesource111"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote111">*</a> and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples. <span id="chapter9_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>And this house will become heaps of ruins. Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will whistle and say, ‘Why did Jehovah do that to this land and this house?’ <span id="chapter9_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Then they will say, ‘It was because they abandoned Jehovah their God, who had brought their forefathers out of the land of Egypt, and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them. That is why Jehovah brought all this calamity on them.’”</p>
