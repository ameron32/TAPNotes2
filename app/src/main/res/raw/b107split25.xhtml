You should not sow your field with seed or prune your vineyard. <span id="chapter25_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>You must not reap what grows on its own from the grain left after the harvest, and the grapes of your unpruned vine you must not gather. There should be a year of complete rest for the land. <span id="chapter25_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>However, you may eat the food that grows in the land during its sabbath; you, your male and female slaves, your hired worker, and the foreign settlers who are residing with you may eat it, <span id="chapter25_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>as well as the domestic and the wild animals in your land. Everything the land produces may be eaten.</p>
