Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. <span id="chapter8_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>If anyone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know it as he should know it. <span id="chapter8_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="p41 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Now concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one. <span id="pos22404"></span><span id="chapter8_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>For even though there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many “gods” and many “lords,” <span id="chapter8_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>there is actually to us one God, the Father, from whom all things are and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and we through him.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="p42 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>However, not all have this knowledge. But some, because of their former association with the idol, eat food as something sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. <span id="chapter8_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>But food will not bring us nearer to God; we are no worse off if we do not eat, nor better off if we eat. <span id="chapter8_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>But keep watching that your right to choose does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak. <span id="chapter8_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>For if anyone should see you who have knowledge having a meal in an idol temple, will not the conscience of that one who is weak be emboldened to the point of eating food offered to idols? <span id="chapter8_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>So by your knowledge the man who is weak is being ruined, your brother for whose sake Christ died. <span id="chapter8_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ. <span id="chapter8_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>That is why if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat at all, so that I will not make my brother stumble.</p>
