They will declare how every dispute involving violence should be resolved. <span id="chapter21_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Then all the elders of the city who are nearest to the dead body should wash their hands over the young cow whose neck was broken in the valley, <span id="chapter21_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>and they should declare, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it shed. <span id="chapter21_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Do not hold this against your people Israel, whom you redeemed, O Jehovah, and do not let guilt for innocent blood remain among your people Israel.’ Then the bloodguilt will not be held against them. <span id="chapter21_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>In this way you will remove the guilt of innocent blood from your midst by doing what is right in Jehovah’s eyes.</p>
<p id="p139" data-pid="139" class="p139 sb"><span id="pos89680"></span><span id="chapter21_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>“If you go to war against your enemies and Jehovah your God defeats them for you and you take them captive, <span id="chapter21_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>and you see among the captives a beautiful woman and you are attracted to her and you want to take her as your wife, <span id="chapter21_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>you may bring her into your house. She should then shave her head, attend to her nails, <span id="chapter21_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>and remove <span id="page303" class="pageNum" data-no="303" data-before-text="303"></span>the clothing of her captivity, and dwell in your house. She will weep for her father and her mother a whole month, and afterward you may have relations with her; you will become her husband and she will become your wife. <span id="chapter21_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But if you are not pleased with her, you should then let her go wherever she wishes.<span id="footnotesource143"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote143">*</a> But you may not sell her for money or treat her harshly, since you have humiliated her.</p>

He is a glutton and a drunkard.’ <span id="chapter21_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Then all the men of his city must stone him to death. So you must remove what is bad from your midst, and all Israel will hear and become afraid.</p>

Instead, you should be sure to bury him on that day, because the one hung up is something accursed of God, and you should not defile your land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance.</p>
