<p id="p1121" data-pid="1121" class="p1121 sb"><span id="chapter44_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Jeremiah continued to say to all the people and to all the women: “Hear the word of Jehovah, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt. <span id="chapter44_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘What you and your wives have spoken with your mouths, you have fulfilled with your hands, for you said: “We will surely carry out our vows to make sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven<span id="footnotesource385"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote385">*</a> and to pour out drink offerings to her.” You women will surely carry out your vows and perform your vows.’</p>
<p id="p1122" data-pid="1122" class="p1122 sb"><span id="chapter44_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>“Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, all you of Judah who are living in the land of Egypt: ‘“Here I swear by my own great name,” says Jehovah, “that my name will no longer be called on in an oath by any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt who says, ‘As surely as the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is alive!’ <span id="chapter44_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Now I am watching over them to bring calamity and not something good; all the men of Judah in the land of Egypt will perish by the sword and by the famine, until they cease to exist. <span id="chapter44_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Only a few will escape the sword and return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah.
