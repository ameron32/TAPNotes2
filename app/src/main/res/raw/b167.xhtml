<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="p3 sb"><span id="pos440"></span><span id="chapter1_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>I rejoice very much because I have found some of your children walking in the truth, just as we received commandment from the Father. <span id="chapter1_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>So now I request you, lady, that we love one another. (I am writing you, not a new commandment, but one that we had from the beginning.) <span id="chapter1_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>And this is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should go on walking in it. <span id="pos913"></span><span id="chapter1_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those not acknowledging Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</p>

The one who does remain in this teaching is the one who has both the Father and the Son. <span id="pos1396"></span><span id="chapter1_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him. <span id="chapter1_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.</p>
