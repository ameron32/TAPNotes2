And Og, the king of Baʹshan, came out with all his people to meet us in battle at Edʹre·i. <span id="chapter3_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>So Jehovah said to me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, for I will give him and all his people and his land into your hand, and you will do to him just as you did to Siʹhon the king of the Amʹor·ites, who lived in Heshʹbon.’ <span id="chapter3_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>So Jehovah our God also gave King Og of Baʹshan and all his people into our hand, and we kept striking him down until none of his people survived. <span id="chapter3_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We then captured all his cities. There was no town that we did not take from them—60 cities, all the region of Arʹgob, the kingdom of Og in Baʹshan. <span id="chapter3_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, along with a great number of rural towns. <span id="chapter3_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>However, we devoted them to destruction, just as we had done to King Siʹhon of Heshʹbon, in devoting every city to destruction, including men, women, and children. <span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>And we took all the livestock and the spoil of the cities for ourselves.</p>

His bier<span id="footnotesource20"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote20">*</a> was made of iron,<span id="footnotesource21"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote21">*</a> and it is still in Rabʹbah of the Amʹmon·ites.

All your valiant men will take up arms and cross over before your brothers, the Israelites. <span id="chapter3_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Only your wives, your children, and your livestock (I well know that you have a great deal of livestock) will continue dwelling in the cities that I have given you, <span id="chapter3_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>until Jehovah gives your brothers rest, as he does for you, and they also have taken possession of the land that Jehovah your God will give them across the Jordan.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="p22 sb"><span id="pos16038"></span><span id="chapter3_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>“At that time I pleaded with Jehovah, saying, <span id="chapter3_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>‘O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty arm, for what god in the heavens or on the earth performs such mighty deeds as you? <span id="chapter3_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Please let me pass over and see the good land that is across the Jordan, this good mountainous region and Lebʹa·non.’ <span id="chapter3_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>But Jehovah was still furious with me because of you, and he would not listen to me. Rather, Jehovah said to me, ‘Enough from you! Never speak to me again about this matter. <span id="chapter3_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Go up to the top of Pisʹgah, and look to the west and north and south and east and view the land with your eyes, for you will not cross over this Jordan. <span id="chapter3_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Commission Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, because he is the one who will cross over before this people and he is the one who will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.’ <span id="chapter3_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>All this happened while we were dwelling in the valley in front of Beth-peʹor.</p>
