<p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="p93 sb"><span id="pos53256"></span><span id="chapter16"></span><span id="chapter16_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>16 </strong></span>Now concerning the collection for the holy ones, you may follow the directions I gave to the congregations of Ga·laʹti·a. <span id="chapter16_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>On the first day of every week, each of you should set something aside according to his own means, so that collections will not take place when I arrive. <span id="chapter16_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>But when I get there, I will send the men you approve of in your letters to take your kind gift to Jerusalem. <span id="chapter16_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>However, if it seems advisable for me to go there also, they will go there with me.</p>
<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="p94 sb"><span id="pos53744"></span><span id="chapter16_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>But I will come to you when I have gone through Mac·e·doʹni·a, for I will be going through Mac·e·doʹni·a; <span id="chapter16_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>and perhaps I will stay or even spend the winter with you, so that you may accompany me partway to where I may be going. <span id="chapter16_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>For I do not want to see you now just in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if Jehovah<span id="footnotesource114"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote114">*</a> permits. <span id="chapter16_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>But I am remaining in Ephʹe·sus until the Festival of Pentecost, <span id="chapter16_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>because a large door that leads to activity has been opened to me, but there are many opposers.</p>
<p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="p95 sb"><span id="pos54269"></span><span id="chapter16_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Now if Timothy arrives, make sure that he has nothing to fear while among you, for he is performing the work of Jehovah,<span id="footnotesource115"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote115">*</a> just as I am. <span id="chapter16_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Therefore, let no one look down on him. Send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am waiting for him together with the brothers.</p>
<p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="p96 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Now concerning A·polʹlos our brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers. It was not his intention to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity.</p>
<p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="p97 sb"><span id="pos54756"></span><span id="chapter16_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on in a manly way,<span id="footnotesource116"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote116">*</a> grow mighty. <span id="chapter16_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Let everything you do be done with love.</p>
<p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="p98 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Now I urge you, brothers: You know that the household of Stephʹa·nas is the firstfruits of A·chaʹia and that they devoted themselves to ministering to the holy ones. <span id="chapter16_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>May you also keep submitting yourselves to people like that and to all those cooperating and working hard. <span id="chapter16_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>But I rejoice over the presence of Stephʹa·nas and For·tu·naʹtus and A·chaʹi·cus, because they have made up for your not being here. <span id="chapter16_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, give recognition to men of that sort.</p>
<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="p99 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>The congregations of Asia send you their greetings. Aqʹui·la and Prisʹca together with the congregation that is in their house greet you heartily in the Lord. <span id="chapter16_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="p100 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Here is my greeting, Paul’s, in my own hand.</p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="p101 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>If anyone has no affection for the Lord, let him be accursed. O our Lord, come! <span id="chapter16_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus be with you. <span id="chapter16_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>May my love be with all of you in union with Christ Jesus.</p>
