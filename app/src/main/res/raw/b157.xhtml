<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="p3 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="p4 sb"><span id="pos327"></span><span id="chapter1_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>We are obligated always to give thanks to God for you, brothers. This is fitting, because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another. <span id="chapter1_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>As <span id="page1585" class="pageNum" data-no="1585" data-before-text="1585"></span>a result we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God because of your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the hardships<span id="footnotesource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> that you are suffering.<span id="footnotesource3"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> <span id="chapter1_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>This is a proof of the righteous judgment of God, leading to your being counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you are indeed suffering.</p>
