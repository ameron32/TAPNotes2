<p id="p239" data-pid="239" class="p239 sb">“Hear me, my brothers and my people. It was my heart’s desire to build a house as the resting-place for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and as the footstool of our God, and I made preparations to build. <span id="chapter28_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>But the true God told me, <span id="page602" class="pageNum" data-no="602" data-before-text="602"></span>‘You will not build a house for my name, for you are a man of wars, and you have shed blood.’ <span id="chapter28_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>However, Jehovah the God of Israel chose me out of all the house of my father to become king over Israel forever, for he chose Judah as leader and of the house of Judah, my father’s house, and of my father’s sons, I was the one whom he approved, to make me king over all Israel. <span id="chapter28_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>And of all my sons—for Jehovah has given me many sons—he chose my son Solʹo·mon to sit on the throne of the kingship of Jehovah over Israel.</p>
<p id="p240" data-pid="240" class="p240 sb"><span id="chapter28_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>“He said to me, ‘Your son Solʹo·mon is the one who will build my house and my courtyards, for I have chosen him as my son and I will become his father. <span id="chapter28_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>I will firmly establish his kingship forever if he resolutely observes my commandments and my judicial decisions, as he is now doing.’ <span id="chapter28_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>So I say before the eyes of all Israel, Jehovah’s congregation, and in the ears of our God: Carefully observe and search for all the commandments of Jehovah your God, so that you may possess the good land and pass it on as a permanent inheritance to your sons after you.</p>
<p id="p241" data-pid="241" class="p241 sb"><span id="pos111180"></span><span id="chapter28_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>“And you, Solʹo·mon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a complete<span id="footnotesource152"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote152">*</a> heart and with a delightful<span id="footnotesource153"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote153">*</a> soul,<span id="footnotesource154"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote154">*</a> for Jehovah searches through all hearts, and he discerns every inclination of the thoughts.
