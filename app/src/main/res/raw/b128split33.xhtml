<p id="p1028" data-pid="1028" class="p1028 sb"><span id="chapter33_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>“For this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that are pulled down because of the siege ramparts and the sword, <span id="chapter33_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>and concerning those who are coming to fight the Chal·deʹans, filling these places with the carcasses of those whom I struck down in my anger and in my wrath, those whose evil has caused me to hide my face from this city: <span id="chapter33_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>‘Here I am bringing recuperation and health to her, and I will heal them and reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth. <span id="chapter33_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>And I will bring back the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel, and I will build them up as I did at the start. <span id="chapter33_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>And I will purify them from all the guilt of their sins against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sins and their transgressions against me. <span id="chapter33_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>And she will become to me a name of exultation, a praise, and a beauty before all the nations of the earth who will hear of all the goodness that I bestow on them. And they will be in dread and will tremble because of all the goodness and peace that I will bestow on her.’”</p>
<p id="p1029" data-pid="1029" class="p1029 sb"><span id="chapter33_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>“This is what Jehovah says: ‘In this place that you will say is a wasteland, without man or livestock, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or livestock, there will again be heard <span id="chapter33_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>the sound of exultation and the sound of rejoicing, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying: “Give thanks to Jehovah of armies, for Jehovah is good; his loyal love endures forever!”’</p>
<p id="p1030" data-pid="1030" class="p1030 sb">“‘They will bring thanksgiving offerings into the house of Jehovah, for I will bring back the captives of the land, as at the start,’ says Jehovah.”</p>

<p id="p1037" data-pid="1037" class="p1037 sb"><span id="chapter33_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>“This is what Jehovah says: ‘Just as surely as I have established my covenant regarding the day and the night, the laws<span id="footnotesource294"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote294">*</a> of heaven and earth, <span id="chapter33_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>so I will never reject the offspring<span id="footnotesource295"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote295">*</a> of Jacob and of my servant David, so as not to take from his offspring<span id="footnotesource296"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote296">*</a> rulers over the descendants<span id="footnotesource297"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote297">*</a> of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
