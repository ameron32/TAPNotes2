His mother’s name was Ha·muʹtal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libʹnah. <span id="chapter52_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that Je·hoiʹa·kim had done. <span id="chapter52_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>It was because of Jehovah’s anger that these things took place in Jerusalem and in Judah, until he cast them out of his sight. And Zed·e·kiʹah rebelled against the king of Babylon. <span id="pos234466"></span><span id="chapter52_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>In the ninth year of Zed·e·kiʹah’s reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar<span id="footnotesource466"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote466">*</a> of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem. They camped against it and built a siege wall all around it. <span id="chapter52_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>And the city was under siege until the 11th year of King Zed·e·kiʹah.</p>
<p id="p1566" data-pid="1566" class="p1566 sb"><span id="chapter52_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, and there was no food for the people of the land. <span id="chapter52_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Finally the city wall was broken through, and all the soldiers fled from the city by night through the gate between the double wall near the king’s garden, while the Chal·deʹans were surrounding the city; and they continued by the way of the Arʹa·bah. <span id="chapter52_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>But the Chal·deʹan army pursued the king, and they overtook Zed·e·kiʹah in the desert plains of Jerʹi·cho, and all his troops were scattered from his side. <span id="chapter52_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Ribʹlah in the land of Haʹmath, and he passed sentence on him. <span id="chapter52_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>And the king of Babylon slaughtered Zed·e·kiʹah’s sons before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah there at Ribʹlah. <span id="chapter52_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Then the king of Babylon blinded Zed·e·kiʹah’s eyes, bound him with copper fetters, brought him to Babylon, and kept him imprisoned until the day of his death.</p>

<p id="p1569" data-pid="1569" class="p1569 sb"><span id="chapter52_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>And the Chal·deʹans broke into pieces the copper pillars of the house of Jehovah and the carriages and the copper Sea that were in the house of Jehovah, and they carried all the copper away to Babylon. <span id="chapter52_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>They also took the cans, the shovels, the extinguishers, the bowls, the cups, and all the copper utensils used in the temple service. <span id="chapter52_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>The chief of the guard took the basins, the fire holders, the bowls, the cans, the lampstands, the cups, and the bowls that were of genuine gold and silver. <span id="chapter52_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>As for the two pillars, the Sea, the 12 copper bulls under the Sea, and the carriages that King Solʹo·mon had made for the house of Jehovah, the copper of all these articles was beyond weighing.</p>
