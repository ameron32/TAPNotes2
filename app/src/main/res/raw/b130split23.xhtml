Their breasts were squeezed there, and their virgin bosoms were fondled. <span id="chapter23_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Their names were O·hoʹlah,<span id="footnotesource171"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote171">*</a> the older one, and her sister O·holʹi·bah.<span id="footnotesource172"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote172">*</a> They became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, O·hoʹlah is Sa·marʹi·a, and O·holʹi·bah is Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p205" data-pid="205" class="p205 sb"><span id="pos92032"></span><span id="chapter23_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>“O·hoʹlah began to prostitute herself while she belonged to me. She lusted after her passionate lovers, her neighbors the As·syrʹi·ans. <span id="chapter23_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>They were governors clothed in blue and deputy rulers—all desirable young men mounted on their horses. <span id="chapter23_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>She continued to prostitute herself with all the choicest sons of As·syrʹi·a, and she defiled herself with the disgusting idols<span id="footnotesource173"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote173">*</a> of those she lusted after. <span id="chapter23_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>She did not abandon the prostitution she practiced in Egypt, for in her youth they had lain down with her, and they fondled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust<span id="footnotesource174"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote174">*</a> on her. <span id="chapter23_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>So I gave her into the hand of her passionate lovers, the sons of As·syrʹi·a, after whom she had lusted. <span id="chapter23_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>They exposed her nakedness and seized her sons and daughters, and they killed her with a sword.

When they were coming, you washed yourself and painted your eyes and adorned yourself with ornaments. <span id="chapter23_verse41"></span><strong><sup>41 </sup></strong>And you sat down on a magnificent couch with a table set in front of it, on which you put my incense and my oil. <span id="chapter23_verse42"></span><strong><sup>42 </sup></strong>The sound of a carefree crowd of men was heard there, among whom were drunkards brought in from the wilderness.

<p id="p217" data-pid="217" class="p217 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse43"></span><strong><sup>43 </sup></strong>“Then I said regarding her who was worn out with adultery: ‘Now she will keep committing her prostitution.’ <span id="chapter23_verse44"></span><strong><sup>44 </sup></strong>So they kept going in to her, just as one goes to a prostitute.
