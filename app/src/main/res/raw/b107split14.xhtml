If the leper has been cured of the leprosy, <span id="chapter14_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>the priest will command him to bring two live clean birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop for his cleansing. <span id="chapter14_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The priest will command that the one bird be killed in an earthenware vessel over running water. <span id="chapter14_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>But he should take the living bird along with the cedarwood, the scarlet material, and the hyssop, and dip them together in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. <span id="chapter14_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Then he will spatter it seven times on the one cleansing himself from the leprosy and declare him clean, and he will set the living bird free in the open field.</p>

<p id="p117" data-pid="117" class="p117 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse39"></span><strong><sup>39 </sup></strong>“Then the priest will return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the contamination has spread in the walls of the house, <span id="chapter14_verse40"></span><strong><sup>40 </sup></strong>the priest will then give orders, and the contaminated stones must be torn out and thrown outside the city into an unclean place. <span id="chapter14_verse41"></span><strong><sup>41 </sup></strong>Then he is to have the inside of the house thoroughly scraped, and the plaster and mortar that is removed should be discarded outside the city in an unclean place. <span id="chapter14_verse42"></span><strong><sup>42 </sup></strong>They will then insert other stones in the place of the stones they removed, and he should use different mortar and have the house plastered.</p>
<p id="p118" data-pid="118" class="p118 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse43"></span><strong><sup>43 </sup></strong>“If, though, the contamination returns and breaks out in the house after the stones were torn out and the house was scraped and replastered, <span id="chapter14_verse44"></span><strong><sup>44 </sup></strong>the priest will then go in and inspect it. If the contamination has spread in the house, it is malignant leprosy in the house.
