<p id="p136" data-pid="136" class="p136 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>David gathered the descendants of Aaron and the Levites: <span id="chapter15_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>from the Koʹhath·ites, U·riʹel the chief and 120 of his brothers; <span id="chapter15_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>from the Me·rarʹites, A·saiʹah the chief and 220 of his brothers; <span id="chapter15_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>from the Gerʹshom·ites, Joel the chief and 130 of his brothers; <span id="chapter15_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>from the descendants of E·li·zaʹphan, She·maiʹah the chief and 200 of his brothers; <span id="chapter15_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>from the descendants of Hebʹron, Eʹli·el the chief and 80 of his brothers; <span id="chapter15_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>from the descendants of Uzʹzi·el, Am·minʹa·dab the chief and 112 of his brothers. <span id="chapter15_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Furthermore, David called the priests Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar and the Levites U·riʹel, A·saiʹah, Joel, She·maiʹah, Eʹli·el, and Am·minʹa·dab, <span id="chapter15_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>and he said to them: “You are the heads of the paternal houses of the Levites.

<p id="p139" data-pid="139" class="p139 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Then David and the elders of Israel and the chiefs of the thousands were walking along to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah up from the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom with rejoicing. <span id="chapter15_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>When the true God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, they sacrificed seven young bulls and seven rams. <span id="chapter15_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>David was dressed in a sleeveless coat of fine fabric, as were all the Levites carrying the Ark, the singers, and Chen·a·niʹah the chief of the transport and the singers; David was also wearing a linen ephʹod. <span id="chapter15_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>All the Israelites were bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with joyful shouting, with the sound of the horn, with trumpets, with cymbals, playing loudly on stringed instruments and harps.</p>
