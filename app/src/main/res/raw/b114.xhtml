<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="p2 sb"><span id="pos73"></span><span id="chapter1"></span><span id="chapter1_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>1 </strong></span>After Saul’s death, when David had returned from defeating<span id="footnotesource1"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> the A·malʹek·ites, David stayed at Zikʹlag for two days. <span id="chapter1_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>On the third day, a man came from the camp of Saul with his garments ripped apart and dirt on his head. When he approached David, he fell down to the ground and prostrated himself.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="p3 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>David asked him: “Where are you coming from?” He replied: “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” <span id="chapter1_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>David asked him: “How did things turn out? Please tell me.” To this he said: “The people have fled from the battle and many have fallen and died. Even Saul and his son Jonʹa·than have died.” <span id="chapter1_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Then David asked the young man who brought him the news: “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonʹa·than are dead?” <span id="chapter1_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The young man replied: “By chance I was on Mount Gil·boʹa, and there was Saul supporting himself on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen had caught up with him. <span id="chapter1_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When he turned around and saw me, he called me, and I said, ‘Here I am!’ <span id="chapter1_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I replied, ‘I am an A·malʹek·ite.’ <span id="chapter1_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Then he said, ‘Please stand over me and put me to death, for I am in great agony, but I am still alive.’<span id="footnotesource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> <span id="chapter1_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>So I stood over him and put him to death, for I knew that he could not survive after he had fallen down wounded. Then I took the crown<span id="footnotesource3"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I brought them here to my lord.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="p4 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>At this David took hold of his garments and ripped them apart, and so did all the men who were with him. <span id="chapter1_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>And they wailed and wept and fasted until evening for Saul, for his son Jonʹa·than, for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="p5 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>David asked the young man who brought him the news: “Where are you from?” He said: “I am the son of a foreign resident, an A·malʹek·ite.” <span id="chapter1_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Then David said to him: “Why did you not fear to lift your hand to do away with the anointed of Jehovah?” <span id="chapter1_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>With that David called one of the young men and said: “Step forward and strike him.” So he struck him down, and he died. <span id="chapter1_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>David said to him: “Your blood is on your own head, because your own mouth testified against you by saying, ‘I myself put the anointed of Jehovah to death.’”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="p6 sb"><span id="pos2319"></span><span id="chapter1_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Then David chanted this dirge<span id="footnotesource4"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> over Saul and his son Jonʹa·than <span id="chapter1_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>and said that the people of Judah should be taught the dirge called “The Bow,” which is written in the book of Jaʹshar:</p>
