I was the one who took it.” At that his mother said: “May Jehovah bless my son.” <span id="chapter17_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>So he gave the 1,100 pieces of silver back to his mother, but his mother said: “I will without fail sanctify the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son to use in making a carved image and a metal statue.<span id="footnotesource124"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote124">*</a> Now I give it back to you.”</p>
<p id="p197" data-pid="197" class="p197 sb"><span id="chapter17_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>After he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took 200 silver pieces and gave them to the silversmith. He made a carved image and a metal statue;<span id="footnotesource125"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote125">*</a> and they were put in Miʹcah’s house. <span id="chapter17_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>This man Miʹcah had a house of gods, and he made an ephʹod and teraphim statues<span id="footnotesource126"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote126">*</a> and installed<span id="footnotesource127"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote127">*</a> one of <span id="page384" class="pageNum" data-no="384" data-before-text="384"></span>his sons to serve as priest for him. <span id="chapter17_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In those days, there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.<span id="footnotesource128"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote128">*</a></p>
<p id="p198" data-pid="198" class="p198 sb"><span id="chapter17_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Now there was a young man of Bethʹle·hem in Judah who was of the family of Judah. He was a Levite who had been living there for a time. <span id="chapter17_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The man left the city of Bethʹle·hem in Judah to find a place to live. While on his journey, he came to the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, to the house of Miʹcah. <span id="chapter17_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Then Miʹcah said to him: “Where do you come from?” He replied: “I am a Levite from Bethʹle·hem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to live.” <span id="chapter17_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>So Miʹcah said to him: “Stay with me and serve as a father<span id="footnotesource129"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote129">*</a> and a priest for me. I will give you ten silver pieces a year and a set of garments and your food.” So the Levite went in. <span id="chapter17_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Thus the Levite agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons. <span id="chapter17_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Furthermore, Miʹcah installed<span id="footnotesource130"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote130">*</a> the Levite to serve as a priest for him, and he lived in the house of Miʹcah. <span id="chapter17_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Then Miʹcah said: “Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me, for the Levite has become my priest.”</p>
