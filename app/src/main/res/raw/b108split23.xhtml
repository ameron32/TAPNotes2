And Baʹlak and Baʹlaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. <span id="chapter23_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Baʹlaam then said to Baʹlak: “Stay here by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Jehovah will get in touch with me. Whatever he reveals to me, I will tell you.” So he went to a barren hill.</p>
<p id="p242" data-pid="242" class="p242 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Then God got in touch with Baʹlaam, who said to Him: “I set the seven altars in rows, and I offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.” <span id="chapter23_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah put this word in the mouth of Baʹlaam: “Return to Baʹlak, and this is what you are to say.” <span id="chapter23_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>So he returned and saw that Baʹlak and all the princes of Moʹab were standing by his burnt offering. <span id="chapter23_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Then he spoke this proverbial saying:</p>
<p id="p243" data-pid="243" class="p243 sz">“Baʹlak the king of Moʹab has brought me from Aʹram,</p><p data-pid="243" class="p243 sz">From the mountains of the east:</p>

<p id="p245" data-pid="245" class="p245 sz">Yes, come to denounce Israel.’</p>
<p id="p246" data-pid="246" class="p246 sl"><span id="chapter23_verse8"></span> <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>How could I put a curse on those whom God has not cursed?</p>
<p id="p247" data-pid="247" class="p247 sz">And how could I denounce those whom Jehovah has not denounced?</p>
<p id="p248" data-pid="248" class="p248 sl"><span id="chapter23_verse9"></span> <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>From the top of the rocks I see them,</p><p data-pid="248" class="p248 sz">And from the hills I see them.</p>
<p id="p249" data-pid="249" class="p249 sz">As a people they dwell there alone;</p><p data-pid="249" class="p249 sz">They do not count themselves among the nations.</p>
<p id="p250" data-pid="250" class="p250 sl"><span id="chapter23_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Who can number the dust particles of Jacob</p><p data-pid="250" class="p250 sz">Or count even the fourth part of Israel?</p>

<p id="p252" data-pid="252" class="p252 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Baʹlak then said to Baʹlaam: “What have you done to me? I brought you to put a curse on my enemies, and here you have done nothing but bless them.” <span id="chapter23_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>He answered: “Must I not speak whatever Jehovah puts in my mouth?”</p>
<p id="p253" data-pid="253" class="p253 sb"><span id="pos117266"></span><span id="chapter23_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Baʹlak said to him: “Please come with me to another place from which you can see them. You will see only a part of them; you will not see them all. Put a curse on them for me from there.” <span id="chapter23_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>So he took him to the field of Zoʹphim, to the top of Pisʹgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. <span id="chapter23_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>So Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Stay here by your burnt offering while I get in touch with Him over there.” <span id="chapter23_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>And Jehovah got in touch with Baʹlaam and put this word in his mouth: “Return to Baʹlak, and this is what you are to say.” <span id="chapter23_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>So he came to him and saw that he was waiting by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moʹab were with him. Baʹlak asked him: “What has Jehovah said?” <span id="chapter23_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Then he spoke this proverbial saying:</p>
<p id="p254" data-pid="254" class="p254 sz">“Get up, Baʹlak, and listen.</p>
<p id="p255" data-pid="255" class="p255 sz">Hear me, O son of Zipʹpor.</p>

<p id="p260" data-pid="260" class="p260 sl"><span id="chapter23_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>He does not tolerate any magical power against Jacob,</p><p data-pid="260" class="p260 sz">And he does not allow any trouble against Israel.</p>
<p id="p261" data-pid="261" class="p261 sz">Jehovah his God is with them,</p><p data-pid="261" class="p261 sz">And he is loudly hailed as king among them.</p>

<p id="p263" data-pid="263" class="p263 sz">He is like the horns of a wild bull for them.</p>
<p id="p264" data-pid="264" class="p264 sl"><span id="chapter23_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>For there are no omens of doom against Jacob,</p><p data-pid="264" class="p264 sz">Nor any divination against Israel.</p>
<p id="p265" data-pid="265" class="p265 sz">At this time it may be said about Jacob and Israel:</p>
<p id="p266" data-pid="266" class="p266 sz">‘Look at what God has done!’</p>
<p id="p267" data-pid="267" class="p267 sl"><span id="chapter23_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Here is a people who will rise up like a lion,</p><p data-pid="267" class="p267 sz">And like the lion, it will raise itself up.</p>
<p id="p268" data-pid="268" class="p268 sz">It will not lie down until it eats prey</p><p data-pid="268" class="p268 sz">And drinks the blood of the slain ones.”</p>
<p id="p269" data-pid="269" class="p269 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Baʹlak then said to Baʹlaam: “If on the one hand you cannot put any curse on him, then on the other hand you should not bless him either.” <span id="chapter23_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Baʹlaam answered Baʹlak: “Did I not say to you, ‘I will do all that Jehovah says’?”</p>
<p id="p270" data-pid="270" class="p270 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Baʹlak said to Baʹlaam: “Please come and let me take you to yet another place.
