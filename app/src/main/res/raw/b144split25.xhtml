Go out to meet him.’ <span id="chapter25_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order. <span id="chapter25_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The foolish said to the discreet, ‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out.’ <span id="chapter25_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The discreet answered, saying: ‘Perhaps there may not be enough for both us and you. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy some for yourselves.’ <span id="chapter25_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>While they were going off to buy it, the bridegroom came. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. <span id="chapter25_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Afterward, the rest of the virgins also came, saying, ‘Sir, Sir, open to us!’ <span id="chapter25_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>In answer he said, ‘I tell you the truth, I do not know you.’</p>

<p id="p203" data-pid="203" class="p203 sb"><span id="pos110386"></span><span id="chapter25_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>“For it is just like a man about to travel abroad who summoned his slaves and entrusted his belongings to them. <span id="chapter25_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>He gave five talents<span id="footnotesource166"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote166">*</a> to one, two to another, and one to still another, to each according to his own ability, and he went abroad. <span id="chapter25_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Immediately the one who received <span id="page1341" class="pageNum" data-no="1341" data-before-text="1341"></span>the five talents went and did business with them and gained five more. <span id="chapter25_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Likewise, the one who received the two gained two more. <span id="chapter25_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>But the slave who received just one went off and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.<span id="footnotesource167"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote167">*</a></p>
<p id="p204" data-pid="204" class="p204 sb"><span id="chapter25_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>“After a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. <span id="chapter25_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>So the one who had received the five talents came forward and brought five additional talents, saying, ‘Master, you entrusted five talents to me; see, I gained five talents more.’ <span id="chapter25_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>His master said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’ <span id="chapter25_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Next the one who had received the two talents came forward and said, ‘Master, you entrusted two talents to me; see, I gained two talents more.’ <span id="chapter25_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>His master said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’</p>
<p id="p205" data-pid="205" class="p205 sb"><span id="chapter25_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>“Finally the slave who had received the one talent came forward and said: ‘Master, I knew you to be a demanding man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow. <span id="chapter25_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>So I grew afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’ <span id="chapter25_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>In reply his master said to him: ‘Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow? <span id="chapter25_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Well, then, you should have deposited my money<span id="footnotesource168"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote168">*</a> with the bankers, and on my coming I would have received it back with interest.</p>
<p id="p206" data-pid="206" class="p206 sb"><span id="chapter25_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>“‘Therefore, take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. <span id="chapter25_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. <span id="chapter25_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>And throw the good-for-nothing slave out into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.’</p>
