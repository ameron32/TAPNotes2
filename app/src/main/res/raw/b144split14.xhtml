He was raised up from the dead, and this is why these powerful works are operating in him.” <span id="chapter14_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Herod<span id="footnotesource86"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote86">*</a> had arrested John and had bound him and imprisoned him because of He·roʹdi·as, the wife of Philip his brother. <span id="chapter14_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>For John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.” <span id="chapter14_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>However, although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they took him for a prophet. <span id="chapter14_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>But when Herod’s birthday was being celebrated, the daughter of He·roʹdi·as danced for the occasion and pleased Herod so much <span id="chapter14_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. <span id="chapter14_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Then she, at her mother’s prompting, said: “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” <span id="chapter14_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Grieved though he was, the king, out of <span id="page1325" class="pageNum" data-no="1325" data-before-text="1325"></span>regard for his oaths and for those dining<span id="footnotesource87"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote87">*</a> with him, commanded it to be given. <span id="chapter14_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison. <span id="chapter14_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. <span id="chapter14_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Later his disciples came and removed his corpse and buried him; then they came and reported to Jesus. <span id="pos60070"></span><span id="chapter14_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>At hearing this, Jesus departed from there by boat into an isolated place to be alone. But the crowds, getting to hear of it, followed him on foot from the cities.</p>
<p id="p117" data-pid="117" class="p117 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>When he came ashore, he saw a large crowd, and he felt pity for them, and he cured their sick ones. <span id="chapter14_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>But when evening fell, his disciples came to him and said: “The place is isolated and the hour is already late; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.” <span id="chapter14_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>However, Jesus said to them: “They do not have to leave; you give them something to eat.” <span id="chapter14_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>They said to him: “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.” <span id="chapter14_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>He said: “Bring them here to me.” <span id="chapter14_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>And he instructed the crowds to recline on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said a blessing, and after breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. <span id="chapter14_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftover fragments, 12 baskets full. <span id="chapter14_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Now those eating were about 5,000 men, as well as women and young children. <span id="pos61213"></span><span id="chapter14_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Then, without delay, he made his disciples board the boat and go ahead of him to the opposite shore, while he sent the crowds away.</p>
<p id="p118" data-pid="118" class="p118 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>After sending the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. <span id="chapter14_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>By now the boat was many hundreds of yards<span id="footnotesource88"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote88">*</a> away from land, struggling against the waves because the wind was against them. <span id="chapter14_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>But in the fourth watch of the night<span id="footnotesource89"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote89">*</a> he came to them, walking on the sea. <span id="chapter14_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>When they caught sight of him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying: “It is an apparition!” And they cried out in their fear. <span id="chapter14_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>But at once Jesus spoke to them, saying: “Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.” <span id="chapter14_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Peter answered him: “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.” <span id="chapter14_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>He said: “Come!” So Peter got out of the boat and walked over the waters and went toward Jesus. <span id="chapter14_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>But looking at the windstorm, he became afraid. And when he started to sink, he cried out: “Lord, save me!” <span id="chapter14_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>Immediately stretching out his hand, Jesus caught hold of him and said to him: “You with little faith, why did you give way to doubt?” <span id="chapter14_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>After they got up into the boat, the windstorm abated. <span id="chapter14_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>Then those in the boat did obeisance<span id="footnotesource90"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote90">*</a> to him, saying: “You really are God’s Son.” <span id="pos62538"></span><span id="chapter14_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>And they crossed over and came to land in Gen·nesʹa·ret.</p>
<p id="p119" data-pid="119" class="p119 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>On recognizing him, the men of that place sent word into all that surrounding country, and people brought him all those who were ill. <span id="chapter14_verse36"></span><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>And they pleaded with him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment, and all those who touched it were made completely well.</p>
