<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="p19 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>A man does not take this honor of his own accord, but he receives it only when he is called by God, just as Aaron was. <span id="chapter5_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>So, too, the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by the One who said to him: “You are my son; today I have become your father.” <span id="pos10220"></span><span id="chapter5_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>As he also says in another place, “You are a priest forever in the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek.”</p>
