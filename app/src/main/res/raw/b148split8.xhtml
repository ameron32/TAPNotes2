<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="p47 sb"><span id="pos35249"></span><span id="chapter8"></span><span id="chapter8_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>8 </strong></span>Saul, for his part, approved of his murder.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="p48 sb">On that day great persecution arose against the congregation that was in Jerusalem; <span id="page1472" class="pageNum" data-no="1472" data-before-text="1472"></span>all except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of Ju·deʹa and Sa·marʹi·a. <span id="chapter8_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>But devout men carried Stephen away to bury him, and they made a great mourning over him. <span id="chapter8_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Saul, though, began to ravage the congregation. He would invade one house after another, dragging out both men and women and turning them over to prison.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="p49 sb"><span id="pos35729"></span><span id="chapter8_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>However, those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word. <span id="chapter8_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Now Philip went down to the city<span id="footnotesource79"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote79">*</a> of Sa·marʹi·a and began to preach the Christ to them. <span id="chapter8_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The crowds with one accord were paying attention to what Philip said while they listened and observed the signs he was performing. <span id="chapter8_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>For many had unclean spirits, and these would cry out with a loud voice and come out. Moreover, many who were paralyzed and lame were cured. <span id="chapter8_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>So there came to be a great deal of joy in that city.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="p50 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Now in the city was a man named Simon, who prior to this had been practicing magical arts and amazing the nation of Sa·marʹi·a, claiming that he was somebody great. <span id="chapter8_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>All of them, from the least to the greatest, would pay attention to him and say: “This man is the Power of God, which is called Great.” <span id="chapter8_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>So they would pay attention to him because he had amazed them for quite a while by his magical arts. <span id="chapter8_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>But when they believed Philip, who was declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were getting baptized. <span id="chapter8_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Simon himself also became a believer, and after being baptized, he continued with Philip; and he was amazed at seeing the signs and great powerful works taking place.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="p51 sb"><span id="pos37027"></span><span id="chapter8_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Sa·marʹi·a had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them; <span id="chapter8_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit. <span id="chapter8_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>For it had not yet come upon any one of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <span id="chapter8_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Then they laid their hands on them, and they began to receive holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="p52 sb"><span id="pos37420"></span><span id="chapter8_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Now when Simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money, <span id="chapter8_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>saying: “Give me this authority also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive holy spirit.” <span id="chapter8_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>But Peter said to him: “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could acquire the free gift of God with money. <span id="chapter8_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>You have neither part nor share in this matter, for your heart is not straight in the sight of God. <span id="chapter8_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>So repent of this badness of yours, and supplicate Jehovah<span id="footnotesource80"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote80">*</a> that, if possible, the wicked intention of your heart may be forgiven you; <span id="chapter8_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>for I see you are a bitter poison<span id="footnotesource81"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote81">*</a> and a slave of unrighteousness.” <span id="chapter8_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>In answer Simon said to them: “Make supplication for me to Jehovah<span id="footnotesource82"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote82">*</a> that none of the things you have said may come upon me.”</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="p53 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Therefore, when they had given the witness thoroughly and had spoken the word of Jehovah,<span id="footnotesource83"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote83">*</a> they started back toward Jerusalem, and they went declaring the good news to many villages of the Sa·marʹi·tans.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="p54 sb"><span id="pos38459"></span><span id="chapter8_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>However, Jehovah’s<span id="footnotesource84"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote84">*</a> angel spoke to Philip, saying: “Get up and go to the south to the <span id="page1473" class="pageNum" data-no="1473" data-before-text="1473"></span>road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gazʹa.” (This is a desert road.) <span id="chapter8_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>With that he got up and went, and look! an E·thi·oʹpi·an eunuch,<span id="footnotesource85"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote85">*</a> a man who had authority under Can·daʹce, queen of the E·thi·oʹpi·ans, and who was in charge of all her treasure. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship, <span id="chapter8_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>and he was returning and was sitting in his chariot, reading aloud the prophet Isaiah. <span id="chapter8_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>So the spirit said to Philip: “Go over and approach this chariot.” <span id="chapter8_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>Philip ran alongside and heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet, and he said: “Do you actually know<span id="footnotesource86"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote86">*</a> what you are reading?” <span id="chapter8_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>He said: “Really, how could I ever do so unless someone guided me?” So he urged Philip to get on and sit down with him. <span id="chapter8_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>Now this was the passage of Scripture that he was reading: “Like a sheep he was brought to the slaughter, and like a lamb that is silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth. <span id="chapter8_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>During his humiliation, justice was taken away from him. Who will tell the details of his generation? Because his life is taken away from the earth.”</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="p55 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>The eunuch then said to Philip: “I beg you, about whom does the prophet say this? About himself or about some other man?” <span id="chapter8_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he declared to him the good news about Jesus. <span id="chapter8_verse36"></span><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>Now as they were going along the road, they came to a body of water, and the eunuch said: “Look! Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?” <span id="chapter8_verse37"></span><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><span id="footnotesource87"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote87">*</a> —— <span id="chapter8_verse38"></span><strong><sup>38 </sup></strong>With that he commanded the chariot to halt, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him. <span id="chapter8_verse39"></span><strong><sup>39 </sup></strong>When they came up out of the water, Jehovah’s<span id="footnotesource88"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote88">*</a> spirit quickly led Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him anymore, but he went on his way rejoicing. <span id="chapter8_verse40"></span><strong><sup>40 </sup></strong>Philip, however, found himself in Ashʹdod, and he went through the territory and kept on declaring the good news to all the cities until he got to Caes·a·reʹa.</p>
