So A·ha·ziʹah the son of Je·hoʹram began to reign as king of Judah. <span id="chapter22_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>A·ha·ziʹah was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem.

<p id="p129" data-pid="129" class="p129 sb"><span id="chapter22_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>He too walked in the ways of the house of Aʹhab, for his mother became his adviser in acting wickedly. <span id="chapter22_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>And he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, like the house of Aʹhab, for they became his advisers after the death of his father, to his destruction. <span id="chapter22_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>He followed their advice and went with Je·hoʹram the son of King Aʹhab of Israel to wage war against King Hazʹa·el of Syria at Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad, where the archers wounded Je·hoʹram. <span id="chapter22_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>He returned to Jezʹre·el to recover from the wounds that they had inflicted on him at Raʹmah when he fought against King Hazʹa·el of Syria.</p>

Je·ho·shabʹe·ath the daughter of King Je·hoʹram (she was the wife of Je·hoiʹa·da the priest and a sister of A·ha·ziʹah) managed to keep him concealed from Ath·a·liʹah, so that she did not put him to death. <span id="chapter22_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>He remained with them for six years, hidden at the house of the true God, while Ath·a·liʹah was ruling over the land.</p>
