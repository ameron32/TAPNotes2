<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="p2 sb"><span id="pos42"></span><span id="chapter1"></span><span id="chapter1_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>1 </strong></span>There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job.<span id="footnotesource1"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> He was an upright man of integrity;<span id="footnotesource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> he feared God and shunned what was bad. <span id="chapter1_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. <span id="chapter1_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>His livestock amounted to 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 cattle,<span id="footnotesource3"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> and 500 donkeys,<span id="footnotesource4"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> along with a very large number of servants, so that he became the greatest of all the people of the East.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="p3 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Each of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day.<span id="footnotesource5"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. <span id="chapter1_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>After a series of banquet days was complete, Job would send for them in order to sanctify them. Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them. For <span id="page701" class="pageNum" data-no="701" data-before-text="701"></span>Job said: “Maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.” That is what Job would always do.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="p4 sb"><span id="pos880"></span><span id="chapter1_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Now the day came when the sons of the true God<span id="footnotesource6"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="p5 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.” <span id="chapter1_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of<span id="footnotesource7"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity,<span id="footnotesource8"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> fearing God and shunning what is bad.” <span id="chapter1_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>At that Satan answered Jehovah: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? <span id="chapter1_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has spread out in the land. <span id="chapter1_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” <span id="chapter1_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand.<span id="footnotesource9"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence<span id="footnotesource10"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="p6 sb"><span id="pos1922"></span><span id="chapter1_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Now on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, <span id="chapter1_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>a messenger came to Job and said: “The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them <span id="chapter1_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>when the Sa·beʹans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="p7 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “Fire from God<span id="footnotesource11"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them! I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="p8 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “The Chal·deʹans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="p9 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>While he was still speaking, yet another one came and said: “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house. <span id="chapter1_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Suddenly a great wind came from the wilderness, and it struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell on the young people and they were killed. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="p10 sb"><span id="pos3086"></span><span id="chapter1_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>At that Job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head; then he fell to the ground and bowed down <span id="chapter1_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>and said:</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="p11 sz">“Naked I came out of my mother’s womb,</p><p data-pid="11" class="p11 sz">And naked I will return.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="p12 sz">Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="p13 sz">Let the name of Jehovah continue to be praised.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="p14 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>In all of this, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong.<span id="footnotesource12"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a></p>
