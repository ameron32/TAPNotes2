<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="p58 sb"><span id="pos39567"></span><span id="chapter8"></span><span id="chapter8_verse12"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>8 </strong></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying: “I am the light of the world. Whoever <span id="page1438" class="pageNum" data-no="1438" data-before-text="1438"></span>follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.” <span id="chapter8_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>So the Pharisees said to him: “You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true.” <span id="chapter8_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>In answer Jesus said to them: “Even if I do bear witness about myself, my witness is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from and where I am going. <span id="chapter8_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>You judge according to the flesh;<span id="footnotesource37"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote37">*</a> I do not judge any man at all. <span id="chapter8_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>And yet even if I do judge, my judgment is truthful, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. <span id="chapter8_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Also, in your own Law it is written: ‘The witness of two men is true.’ <span id="chapter8_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>I am one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.” <span id="chapter8_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Then they said to him: “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “You know neither me nor my Father. If you did know me, you would know my Father also.” <span id="chapter8_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>He spoke these words in the treasury as he was teaching in the temple. But no one seized him, for his hour had not yet come.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="p59 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>So he said to them again: “I am going away, and you will look for me, and yet you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.” <span id="chapter8_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>The Jews then began to say: “He will not kill himself, will he? Because he says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’” <span id="chapter8_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>He went on to say to them: “You are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. You are from this world; I am not from this world. <span id="chapter8_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>That is why I said to you: You will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am the one, you will die in your sins.” <span id="chapter8_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>So they began to say to him: “Who are you?” Jesus replied to them: “Why am I even speaking to you at all? <span id="chapter8_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>I have many things to speak concerning you and to pass judgment on. As a matter of fact, the One who sent me is true, and the very things I heard from him I am speaking in the world.” <span id="chapter8_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>They did not grasp that he was talking to them about the Father. <span id="chapter8_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Jesus then said: “After you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me, I speak these things. <span id="chapter8_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>And the One who sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.” <span id="chapter8_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>As he was saying these things, many put faith in him.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="p60 sb"><span id="pos42048"></span><span id="chapter8_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>Then Jesus went on to say to the Jews who had believed him: “If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, <span id="pos42171"></span><span id="chapter8_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” <span id="chapter8_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>They replied to him: “We are Abraham’s offspring and never have been slaves to anyone. How is it you say, ‘You will become free’?” <span id="chapter8_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>Jesus answered them: “Most truly I say to you, every doer of sin is a slave of sin. <span id="chapter8_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>Moreover, the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever. <span id="chapter8_verse36"></span><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>So if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free. <span id="chapter8_verse37"></span><strong><sup>37 </sup></strong>I know that you are Abraham’s offspring. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among you. <span id="chapter8_verse38"></span><strong><sup>38 </sup></strong>I speak the things I have seen while with my Father, but you do the things you have heard from your father.” <span id="chapter8_verse39"></span><strong><sup>39 </sup></strong>In answer they said to him: “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them: “If you were Abraham’s children, you would be doing the works of Abraham. <span id="chapter8_verse40"></span><strong><sup>40 </sup></strong>But now <span id="page1439" class="pageNum" data-no="1439" data-before-text="1439"></span>you are seeking to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this. <span id="chapter8_verse41"></span><strong><sup>41 </sup></strong>You are doing the works of your father.” They said to him: “We were not born from immorality;<span id="footnotesource38"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote38">*</a> we have one Father, God.”</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="p61 sb"><span id="pos43280"></span><span id="chapter8_verse42"></span><strong><sup>42 </sup></strong>Jesus said to them: “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I have not come of my own initiative, but that One sent me. <span id="chapter8_verse43"></span><strong><sup>43 </sup></strong>Why do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot listen to my word. <span id="chapter8_verse44"></span><strong><sup>44 </sup></strong>You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father. That one was a murderer when he began,<span id="footnotesource39"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote39">*</a> and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie. <span id="chapter8_verse45"></span><strong><sup>45 </sup></strong>Because I, on the other hand, tell you the truth, you do not believe me. <span id="chapter8_verse46"></span><strong><sup>46 </sup></strong>Who of you convicts me of sin? If I speak truth, why is it that you do not believe me? <span id="chapter8_verse47"></span><strong><sup>47 </sup></strong>The one who is from God listens to the sayings of God. This is why you do not listen, because you are not from God.”</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="p62 sb"><span id="pos44156"></span><span id="chapter8_verse48"></span><strong><sup>48 </sup></strong>In answer the Jews said to him: “Are we not right in saying, ‘You are a Sa·marʹi·tan and have a demon’?” <span id="chapter8_verse49"></span><strong><sup>49 </sup></strong>Jesus answered: “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. <span id="chapter8_verse50"></span><strong><sup>50 </sup></strong>But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One who is seeking and judging. <span id="chapter8_verse51"></span><strong><sup>51 </sup></strong>Most truly I say to you, if anyone observes my word, he will never see death at all.” <span id="chapter8_verse52"></span><strong><sup>52 </sup></strong>The Jews said to him: “Now we do know that you have a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets, but you say, ‘If anyone observes my word, he will never taste death at all.’ <span id="chapter8_verse53"></span><strong><sup>53 </sup></strong>You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who do you claim to be?” <span id="chapter8_verse54"></span><strong><sup>54 </sup></strong>Jesus answered: “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, the one who you say is your God. <span id="chapter8_verse55"></span><strong><sup>55 </sup></strong>Yet you have not known him, but I know him. And if I said I do not know him, I would be like you, a liar. But I do know him and am observing his word. <span id="chapter8_verse56"></span><strong><sup>56 </sup></strong>Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.” <span id="chapter8_verse57"></span><strong><sup>57 </sup></strong>Then the Jews said to him: “You are not yet 50 years old, and still you have seen Abraham?” <span id="chapter8_verse58"></span><strong><sup>58 </sup></strong>Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to you, before Abraham came into existence, I have been.” <span id="chapter8_verse59"></span><strong><sup>59 </sup></strong>So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid and went out of the temple.</p>
