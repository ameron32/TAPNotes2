<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="p27 sb"><span id="pos12174"></span><span id="chapter4_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>All around the throne were 24 thrones, and on these thrones I saw seated 24 elders dressed in white garments, and on their heads golden crowns. <span id="chapter4_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>From the throne were coming lightning and voices and thunders; and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, and these mean the seven spirits of God. <span id="pos12495"></span><span id="chapter4_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Before the throne was something resembling a glassy sea, like crystal.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="p28 sb">In the midst of the throne<span id="footnotesource18"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote18">*</a> and around the throne were four living creatures that were full of eyes in front and behind. <span id="chapter4_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature was like a young bull, and the third living creature had a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. <span id="chapter4_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>As for the four living creatures, each one of them had six wings; they were full of eyes all around and underneath. And continuously, day and night, they say: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah<span id="footnotesource19"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote19">*</a> God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="p29 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to the One seated on the throne, the One who lives forever and ever, <span id="chapter4_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>the 24 elders fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship the One who lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying: <span id="chapter4_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>“You are worthy, Jehovah<span id="footnotesource20"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote20">*</a> our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.”</p>
