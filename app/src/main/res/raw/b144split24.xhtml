Truly I say to you, by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.”</p>
<p id="p189" data-pid="189" class="p189 sb"><span id="chapter24_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence<span id="footnotesource158"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote158">*</a> and of the conclusion of the system of things?”<span id="footnotesource159"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote159">*</a></p>
<p id="p190" data-pid="190" class="p190 sb"><span id="chapter24_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>In answer Jesus said to them: “Look out that nobody misleads you, <span id="chapter24_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will mislead many. <span id="chapter24_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for these things must take place, but the end is not yet.</p>

<p id="p194" data-pid="194" class="p194 sb"><span id="chapter24_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>“Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look! Here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There!’ do not believe it. <span id="chapter24_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones. <span id="chapter24_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Look! I have forewarned you. <span id="chapter24_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Therefore, if people say to you, ‘Look! He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; ‘Look! He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. <span id="chapter24_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>For just as the lightning comes out of the east and shines over to the west, so the presence<span id="footnotesource161"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote161">*</a> of the Son of man will be. <span id="chapter24_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</p>

<p id="p197" data-pid="197" class="p197 sb"><span id="chapter24_verse36"></span><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>“Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father. <span id="pos107439"></span><span id="chapter24_verse37"></span><strong><sup>37 </sup></strong>For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence<span id="footnotesource162"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote162">*</a> of the Son of man will be. <span id="chapter24_verse38"></span><strong><sup>38 </sup></strong>For as <span id="page1340" class="pageNum" data-no="1340" data-before-text="1340"></span>they were in those days before the Flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, <span id="chapter24_verse39"></span><strong><sup>39 </sup></strong>and they took no note until the Flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be. <span id="chapter24_verse40"></span><strong><sup>40 </sup></strong>Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken along and the other abandoned. <span id="chapter24_verse41"></span><strong><sup>41 </sup></strong>Two women will be grinding at the hand mill; one will be taken along and the other abandoned. <span id="pos108015"></span><span id="chapter24_verse42"></span><strong><sup>42 </sup></strong>Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.</p>
