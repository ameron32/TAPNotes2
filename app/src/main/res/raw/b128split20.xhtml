<p id="p710" data-pid="710" class="p710 sb">“Jehovah has named you, not Pashʹhur, but Terror All Around. <span id="chapter20_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>For this is what Jehovah says, ‘I will make you an object of terror to yourself and to all your friends, and they will fall by the sword of their enemies while your eyes are looking on; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take them into exile in Babylon and put them to death by the sword. <span id="chapter20_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>And I will give all the wealth of this city, all its resources, all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. And they will plunder them and seize them and take them to Babylon. <span id="chapter20_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>And as for you, Pashʹhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity. You will go off to Babylon and die there, and you will be buried there with all your friends, because you have prophesied lies to them.’”</p>
<p id="p711" data-pid="711" class="p711 sl"><span id="pos82919"></span><span id="chapter20_verse7"></span> <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>You have fooled me, O Jehovah, and I was fooled.</p>
<p id="p712" data-pid="712" class="p712 sz">You used your strength against me, and you prevailed.</p>
<p id="p713" data-pid="713" class="p713 sz">I have become a laughingstock all day long;</p><p data-pid="713" class="p713 sz">Everyone ridicules me.</p>
<p id="p714" data-pid="714" class="p714 sl"><span id="chapter20_verse8"></span> <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>For whenever I speak, I must cry out and proclaim,</p><p data-pid="714" class="p714 sz">“Violence and destruction!”</p>
<p id="p715" data-pid="715" class="p715 sz">For me the word of Jehovah has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long.</p>
<p id="p716" data-pid="716" class="p716 sl"><span id="pos83276"></span><span id="chapter20_verse9"></span> <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>So I said: “I am not going to make mention of him,</p><p data-pid="716" class="p716 sz">And I will speak no more in his name.”</p>
<p id="p717" data-pid="717" class="p717 sz">But in my heart it became like a burning fire shut up in my bones,</p><p data-pid="717" class="p717 sz">And I was tired of holding it in;</p><p data-pid="717" class="p717 sz">I could no longer endure it.</p>
<p id="p718" data-pid="718" class="p718 sl"><span id="chapter20_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>For I heard many evil rumors;</p><p data-pid="718" class="p718 sz">Terror surrounded me.</p>
<p id="p719" data-pid="719" class="p719 sz">“Denounce him; let us denounce him!”</p>
<p id="p720" data-pid="720" class="p720 sz">Every man wishing me peace was watching for my downfall:</p>
<p id="p721" data-pid="721" class="p721 sz">“Perhaps he will make a foolish mistake,</p><p data-pid="721" class="p721 sz">And we can prevail and take our revenge against him.”</p>
<p id="p722" data-pid="722" class="p722 sl"><span id="pos83772"></span><span id="chapter20_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>But Jehovah was with me like a fearsome warrior.</p>
<p id="p723" data-pid="723" class="p723 sz">That is why those persecuting me will stumble and will not prevail.</p>

<p id="p727" data-pid="727" class="p727 sz">Let me see your vengeance on them,</p><p data-pid="727" class="p727 sz">For to you I have committed my legal case.</p>
<p id="p728" data-pid="728" class="p728 sl"><span id="chapter20_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Sing to Jehovah! Praise Jehovah!</p>
<p id="p729" data-pid="729" class="p729 sz">For he has rescued the poor one<span id="footnotesource179"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote179">*</a> from the hand of evildoers.</p>

<p id="p734" data-pid="734" class="p734 sz">Making him rejoice greatly.</p>
