<p id="p446" data-pid="446" class="p446 sb"><span id="chapter37_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Then I prophesied just as I had been commanded. As soon as I prophesied, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones began to come together, bone to bone. <span id="chapter37_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Then I saw sinews and flesh come on them, and skin covered over them. But there was still no breath in them.</p>
<p id="p447" data-pid="447" class="p447 sb"><span id="chapter37_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>He then said to me: “Prophesy to the wind.

<p id="p448" data-pid="448" class="p448 sb"><span id="chapter37_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>So I prophesied just as he commanded me, and breath<span id="footnotesource285"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote285">*</a> came into them, and they began to live and to stand on their feet, an extremely large army.</p>
<p id="p449" data-pid="449" class="p449 sb"><span id="chapter37_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.
