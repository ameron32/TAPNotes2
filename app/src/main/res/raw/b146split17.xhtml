Nevertheless, woe to the one through whom they come! <span id="chapter17_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>It would be more advantageous for him if a millstone were hung from his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to stumble one of these little ones. <span id="chapter17_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Pay attention to yourselves. If your brother commits a sin, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. <span id="chapter17_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Even if he sins seven times a day against you and he comes back to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”</p>
<p id="p155" data-pid="155" class="p155 sb"><span id="chapter17_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Now the apostles said to the Lord: “Give us more faith.” <span id="chapter17_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Then the Lord said: “If you had faith the size of a mustard grain, you would say to this black mulberry tree, ‘Be <span id="page1410" class="pageNum" data-no="1410" data-before-text="1410"></span>uprooted and planted in the sea!’ and it would obey you.</p>
<p id="p156" data-pid="156" class="p156 sb"><span id="pos100067"></span><span id="chapter17_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>“Which one of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding would say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come here at once and dine at the table’? <span id="chapter17_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Rather, will he not say to him, ‘Get something ready for me to have my evening meal, and put on an apron and serve me until I finish eating and drinking, and afterward you can eat and drink’? <span id="chapter17_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>He will not feel gratitude to the slave because he did what was assigned, will he? <span id="chapter17_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Likewise, when you have done all the things assigned to you, say: ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves. What we have done is what we ought to have done.’”</p>
<p id="p157" data-pid="157" class="p157 sb"><span id="pos100660"></span><span id="chapter17_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>While he was going to Jerusalem, he was passing between Sa·marʹi·a and Galʹi·lee. <span id="chapter17_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>And as he was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met him, but they stood at a distance. <span id="chapter17_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>And they raised their voices and said: “Jesus, Instructor, have mercy on us!” <span id="chapter17_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>When he saw them, he said to them: “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” Then as they were going off, they were cleansed. <span id="chapter17_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. <span id="chapter17_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>And he fell facedown at Jesus’ feet, thanking him. Furthermore, he was a Sa·marʹi·tan. <span id="chapter17_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>In reply Jesus said: “All ten were cleansed, were they not? Where, then, are the other nine? <span id="chapter17_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Did no one else turn back to give glory to God except this man of another nation?” <span id="chapter17_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Then he said to him: “Get up and be on your way; your faith has made you well.”</p>
