<p id="p108" data-pid="108" class="p108 sb"><span id="pos56239"></span><span id="chapter14_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Then the men of Judah approached Joshua in Gilʹgal, and Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh the Kenʹiz·zite said to him: “You well know what Jehovah said to Moses the man of the true God about you and me at Kaʹdesh-barʹne·a. <span id="chapter14_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>I was 40 years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out of Kaʹdesh-barʹne·a to spy out the land, and I returned with a forthright report.<span id="footnotesource84"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote84">*</a> <span id="chapter14_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Although my brothers who went up with me caused the people to lose heart,<span id="footnotesource85"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote85">*</a> I followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly.<span id="footnotesource86"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote86">*</a> <span id="chapter14_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Moses swore on that day, saying: ‘The land on which your foot has walked will become a lasting inheritance for you and your sons, because you have followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly.’ <span id="chapter14_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Now just as he promised, Jehovah has preserved me alive these 45 years since Jehovah made this promise to Moses when Israel walked in the wilderness; I am still here today, 85 years old. <span id="chapter14_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>And today I am as strong as on the day Moses sent me out. My strength is now as it was then, for war and for other activities. <span id="chapter14_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Therefore, give me this mountainous region that Jehovah promised on that day. Though you heard on that day that there were Anʹa·kim there with great fortified cities, surely<span id="footnotesource87"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote87">*</a> Jehovah will be with me, and I will drive them out,<span id="footnotesource88"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote88">*</a> just as Jehovah promised.”</p>
<p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="p109 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebʹron to Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh as an inheritance. <span id="chapter14_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>That is why Hebʹron belongs to Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh the Kenʹiz·zite as an inheritance to this day, because he followed Jehovah the God of Israel wholeheartedly. <span id="chapter14_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>The name of Hebʹron was previously Kirʹi·ath-arʹba (Arʹba was the great man among the Anʹa·kim). And the land had rest from war.</p>
