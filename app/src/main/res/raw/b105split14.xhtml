<p id="p129" data-pid="129" class="p129 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>At this point, the king of Sodʹom went on the march, and also the king of Go·morʹrah, <span id="page58" class="pageNum" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>the king of Adʹmah, the king of Ze·boiʹim, and the king of Beʹla, that is, Zoʹar, and they drew up in battle formation against them in the Valley<span id="footnotesource97"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote97">*</a> of Sidʹdim, <span id="chapter14_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>against Ched·or·la·oʹmer king of Eʹlam, Tiʹdal king of Goiʹim, Amʹra·phel king of Shiʹnar, and Arʹi·och king of El·laʹsar—four kings against the five. <span id="chapter14_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Now the Valley<span id="footnotesource98"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote98">*</a> of Sidʹdim was full of bitumen pits, and the kings of Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah tried to escape and fell into them, and those who remained fled to the mountainous region. <span id="chapter14_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Then the victors took all the goods of Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and all their food and went on their way. <span id="chapter14_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>They also took Lot, the son of Aʹbram’s brother who was dwelling in Sodʹom, as well as his goods, and they continued on their way.</p>
<p id="p130" data-pid="130" class="p130 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>After that a man who had escaped came and told Aʹbram the Hebrew.

These men were allies of Aʹbram. <span id="chapter14_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Thus Aʹbram heard that his relative<span id="footnotesource100"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote100">*</a> had been taken captive. With that he mobilized his trained men, 318 servants born in his household, and went in pursuit up to Dan. <span id="chapter14_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>During the night, he divided his forces, and he and his servants attacked and defeated them.

<p id="p132" data-pid="132" class="p132 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Then he blessed him and said:</p>

<p id="p135" data-pid="135" class="p135 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>After that the king of Sodʹom said to Aʹbram: “Give me the people,<span id="footnotesource102"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote102">*</a> but take the goods for yourself.” <span id="chapter14_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>But Aʹbram said to the king of Sodʹom: “I raise my hand in an oath to Jehovah the Most High God, Maker of heaven and earth, <span id="chapter14_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>that I will not take anything that is yours, from a thread to a sandal lace, so that you may not say, ‘I made Aʹbram rich.’ <span id="chapter14_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>I will take nothing except what the young men have already eaten. As for the share of the men who went with me, Aʹner, Eshʹcol, and Mamʹre—let them take their share.”</p>
