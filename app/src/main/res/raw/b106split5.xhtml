<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="p26 sb"><span id="pos15162"></span><span id="chapter5"></span><span id="chapter5_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>5 </strong></span>Afterward, Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharʹaoh: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘Send my people away so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.’” <span id="chapter5_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>But Pharʹaoh said: “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all, and what is more, I will not send Israel away.” <span id="chapter5_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>But they said: “The God of the Hebrews has communicated with us. Please, we want to make a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; otherwise, he will strike us with disease or with the sword.” <span id="chapter5_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The king of Egypt replied to them: “Why is it, Moses and Aaron, that you are taking the people away from their work? Return to your labor!”<span id="footnotesource22"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote22">*</a> <span id="chapter5_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>And Pharʹaoh continued: “Look at how many people of the land there are, and you would have them rest from their labor.”</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="p27 sb"><span id="pos16024"></span><span id="chapter5_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>That same day, Pharʹaoh commanded the taskmasters and their foremen: <span id="chapter5_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>“You must no longer give straw to the people to make bricks. Let them go <span id="page119" class="pageNum" data-no="119" data-before-text="119"></span>and gather straw for themselves. <span id="chapter5_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>But you must still impose on them the same quota of bricks as they made in the past. Do not reduce it for them, for they are relaxing.<span id="footnotesource23"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote23">*</a> That is why they are crying out, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to our God!’ <span id="chapter5_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Make them work harder, and keep them busy so that they will not pay attention to lies.”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="p28 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>So the taskmasters and their foremen went out and said to the people: “Here is what Pharʹaoh has said, ‘I am giving you no more straw. <span id="chapter5_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Go and get your own straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’” <span id="chapter5_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Then the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. <span id="chapter5_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>And the taskmasters kept urging them: “You must each finish your work every day, just as when straw was provided.” <span id="chapter5_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Also the foremen of the Israelites, whom Pharʹaoh’s taskmasters had appointed over them, were beaten. They asked them: “Why did you not reach the quota of bricks that you used to make? It happened both yesterday and today.”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="p29 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>So the foremen of the Israelites went in and complained to Pharʹaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way? <span id="chapter5_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>No straw is given to your servants, yet they are saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are beaten, but your own people are at fault.” <span id="chapter5_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>But he said: “You are relaxing,<span id="footnotesource24"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote24">*</a> you are relaxing!<span id="footnotesource25"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote25">*</a> That is why you are saying, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to Jehovah.’ <span id="chapter5_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>So now go, get back to work! No straw will be given to you, but you must still produce your quota of bricks.”</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="p30 sb"><span id="pos17757"></span><span id="chapter5_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Then the foremen of the Israelites saw that they were in serious trouble because of the order: “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks at all.” <span id="chapter5_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>After that they met up with Moses and Aaron, who were standing there to meet them as they came out from Pharʹaoh. <span id="chapter5_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>At once they said to them: “May Jehovah look upon you and judge, since you have made Pharʹaoh and his servants despise us<span id="footnotesource26"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote26">*</a> and you have put a sword in their hand to kill us.” <span id="chapter5_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Then Moses turned to Jehovah and said: “Jehovah, why have you afflicted this people? Why have you sent me? <span id="chapter5_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>From the time that I went in before Pharʹaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt worse with this people, and you have certainly not rescued your people.”</p>
