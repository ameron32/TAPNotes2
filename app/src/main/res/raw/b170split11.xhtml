<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="p64 sb"><span id="chapter11_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies. If anyone should want to harm them, this is how he must be killed. <span id="chapter11_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>These have the authority to shut up the sky<span id="footnotesource49"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote49">*</a> so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every sort of plague as often as they wish.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="p65 sb"><span id="pos29491"></span><span id="chapter11_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When they have finished their witnessing, the wild beast that ascends out of the abyss will wage war with them and conquer them and kill them. <span id="chapter11_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>And their corpses will be on the main street of the great city that is in a spiritual sense called Sodʹom and Egypt, where their Lord was also executed on the stake. <span id="chapter11_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues<span id="footnotesource50"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote50">*</a> and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not allow their corpses to be laid in a tomb. <span id="chapter11_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>And those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and celebrate, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those dwelling on the earth.</p>

<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="p69 sb"><span id="chapter11_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>And the 24 elders who were seated before God on their thrones fell upon their faces and worshipped God, <span id="chapter11_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>saying: “We thank you, Jehovah<span id="footnotesource52"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote52">*</a> God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. <span id="pos31228"></span><span id="chapter11_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward your slaves the prophets and the holy ones and those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining<span id="footnotesource53"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote53">*</a> the earth.”</p>
