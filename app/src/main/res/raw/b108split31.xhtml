<p id="p355" data-pid="355" class="p355 sb"><span id="chapter31_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>So Moses spoke to the people, saying: “Equip men from among you for battle<span id="footnotesource215"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote215">*</a> against Midʹi·an and to execute Jehovah’s vengeance on Midʹi·an. <span id="chapter31_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>You should send 1,000 of each tribe of all the tribes of Israel into the army.” <span id="chapter31_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>So from the thousands of Israel, 1,000 were assigned from each tribe, 12,000 equipped for battle.<span id="footnotesource216"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote216">*</a></p>
<p id="p356" data-pid="356" class="p356 sb"><span id="chapter31_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Then Moses sent them out, 1,000 from each tribe to the army, along with Phinʹe·has the son of El·e·aʹzar the priest for the army, who had the holy utensils and the signal trumpets in his hand. <span id="chapter31_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>They waged war against Midʹi·an, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and they killed every male. <span id="pos150423"></span><span id="chapter31_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Along with the others slain, they killed the kings of Midʹi·an, namely, Eʹvi, Reʹkem, Zur, Hur, and Reʹba, the five kings of Midʹi·an. They also killed Baʹlaam the son of Beʹor with the sword. <span id="chapter31_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>But the Israelites carried off captive the women and children of Midʹi·an. They also plundered all their domestic animals, all their livestock, and all their possessions. <span id="chapter31_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>And all their cities in which they had settled and all their encampments<span id="footnotesource217"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote217">*</a> they burned with fire. <span id="chapter31_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>And they took all the spoil and all the plunder, both humans and animals. <span id="chapter31_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Then they brought the captives, the plunder, and the spoil to Moses and El·e·aʹzar the priest and to the assembly of the Israelites, to the camp in the desert plains of Moʹab near the Jordan at Jerʹi·cho.</p>

<p id="p359" data-pid="359" class="p359 sb"><span id="chapter31_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Jehovah then said this to Moses: <span id="chapter31_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>“Take an inventory of the plunder, counting the captives both of humans and animals; do this together with El·e·aʹzar the priest and the heads of the paternal houses of the assembly. <span id="chapter31_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Divide what was plundered into two parts to be shared between those in the army who took part in the battle and all the rest of the assembly. <span id="chapter31_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>As a tax for Jehovah, you should take from the soldiers who went out into the battle one soul<span id="footnotesource219"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote219">*</a> out of every 500, of the people, the herd, the donkeys, and the flock. <span id="chapter31_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>You should take it from their half and give it to El·e·aʹzar the priest as Jehovah’s contribution. <span id="chapter31_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>From the half given to the Israelites, you should take one out of 50, of the people, the herd, the donkeys, the flock, and every sort of domestic animal, and give them to the Levites, who care for the responsibilities connected with Jehovah’s tabernacle.”</p>
