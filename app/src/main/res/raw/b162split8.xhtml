<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="p32 sb"><span id="pos17852"></span><span id="chapter8"></span><span id="chapter8_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>8 </strong></span>Now this is the main point of what we are saying: We have such a high priest as this, and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, <span id="chapter8_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>a minister<span id="footnotesource37"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote37">*</a> of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah<span id="footnotesource38"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote38">*</a> set up, and not man. <span id="chapter8_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. <span id="chapter8_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already men who offer the gifts according to the Law. <span id="chapter8_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>These men are offering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things; just as Moses, when about to construct the tent, was given the divine command: For He says: “See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.” <span id="chapter8_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry<span id="footnotesource39"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote39">*</a> because he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established on better promises.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="p33 sb"><span id="pos18856"></span><span id="chapter8_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second. <span id="chapter8_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>For he does find fault with the people when he says: “‘Look! The days are coming,’ says Jehovah,<span id="footnotesource40"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote40">*</a> ‘when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant. <span id="chapter8_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not remain in my covenant, so I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah.<span id="footnotesource41"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote41">*</a></p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="p34 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>“‘For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,’ says Jehovah.<span id="footnotesource42"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote42">*</a> ‘I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts I will write them. And I will become their God, and they will become my people.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="p35 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>“‘And they will no longer teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “Know Jehovah!”<span id="footnotesource43"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote43">*</a> For they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them. <span id="chapter8_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>For I will be merciful toward their unrighteous deeds, and I will no longer call their sins to mind.’”</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="p36 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>In his saying “a new covenant,” he has made the former one obsolete. Now what is obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.</p>
