He should not drink the vinegar of wine or the vinegar of anything alcoholic. He should not drink any liquid made from grapes, nor eat grapes, whether fresh or dried. <span id="chapter6_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>All the days of his Naziriteship he should not eat anything made from the grapevine, from the unripe grapes to the skins.</p>
