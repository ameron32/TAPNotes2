<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="p15 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>So I opened my mouth, and he made me eat this scroll. <span id="chapter3_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>He went on to say to me: “Son of man, eat this scroll that I am giving you, and fill your stomach with it.” So I began to eat it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="p16 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>He said to me: “Son of man, go in among the house of Israel and speak my words to them. <span id="chapter3_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>For you are not being sent to a people who speak an unintelligible language or an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel. <span id="chapter3_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>You are not being sent to many peoples speaking an unintelligible language or an unknown tongue, whose words you cannot understand. If I would send you to them, they would listen to you. <span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>But the house of Israel will refuse to listen to you, for they do not want to listen to me. All those of the house of Israel are hardheaded and hardhearted. <span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Look! I have made your face exactly as hard as their faces and your forehead exactly as hard as their foreheads. <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or be terrified by their faces, for they are a rebellious house.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="p17 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>He went on to say to me: “Son of man, take to heart and listen to all my words that I speak to you. <span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Go in among the exiles of your people<span id="footnotesource13"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote13">*</a> and speak to them. Tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says,’ whether they listen or refuse to listen.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="p18 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>A spirit then carried me along and I heard behind me a great rumbling sound that said: “May the glory of Jehovah be praised from his place.” <span id="chapter3_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>There was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they were brushing against one another, and the sound of the wheels next to them, and the sound of a great rumbling. <span id="chapter3_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>And the spirit carried me along and took me, and I went in bitterness and in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah rested strongly on me. <span id="chapter3_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>So I went to the exiled people at Tel-aʹbib, who were dwelling by the river Cheʹbar, and I stayed there where they were dwelling; and in a dazed condition, I stayed among them for seven days.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="p21 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>The hand of Jehovah came upon me there, and he said to me: “Get up, go to the valley plain, and I will speak with you there.” <span id="chapter3_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>So I got up and went to the valley plain, and look! the glory of Jehovah was there, like the glory that I saw by the river Cheʹbar, and I fell facedown. <span id="chapter3_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Then spirit entered into me and made me stand up on my feet, and he spoke to me and said:</p>
