<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="p56 sb"><span id="pos22673"></span><span id="chapter4_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>All of this befell King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="p57 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon. <span id="chapter4_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>The king was saying: “Is this not Babylon the Great that I myself have built for the royal house by my own strength and might and for the glory of my majesty?”</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="p58 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>While the word was yet in the king’s mouth, a voice came down from the heavens: “To you it is being said, O King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, ‘The kingdom has gone away from you, <span id="pos23155"></span><span id="chapter4_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>and from mankind you are being driven away.

<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="p59 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>At that moment the word was fulfilled on Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar.
