<p id="p1039" data-pid="1039" class="p1039 sb"><span id="chapter34_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘Go and speak to King Zed·e·kiʹah of Judah and tell him: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘Here I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire. <span id="chapter34_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>And you will not escape out of his hand, for you will without fail be caught and handed over to him. And you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak to you face-to-face, and you will go to Babylon.’ <span id="chapter34_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>However, hear the word of Jehovah, O King Zed·e·kiʹah of Judah, ‘This is what Jehovah says concerning you: “You will not die by the sword. <span id="chapter34_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In peace you will die, and they will make a burning ceremony for you as they did for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, and they will mourn you, ‘Alas, O master!’ for ‘I have spoken the word,’ declares Jehovah.”’”’”</p>
<p id="p1040" data-pid="1040" class="p1040 sb"><span id="chapter34_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jeremiah the prophet then spoke all these words to King Zed·e·kiʹah of Judah in Jerusalem, <span id="chapter34_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>when the armies of the king of Babylon were fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Laʹchish and against A·zeʹkah; for they were the only fortified cities that remained of the cities of Judah.</p>

<p id="p1042" data-pid="1042" class="p1042 sb"><span id="chapter34_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘I made a covenant with your forefathers in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying: <span id="chapter34_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>“At the end of seven years, each of you should free his Hebrew brother who was sold to you and who has served you six years; you must set him free.” But your forefathers did not listen or incline their ears to me. <span id="chapter34_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>And recently<span id="footnotesource299"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote299">*</a> you yourselves turned around and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty to your fellow men, and you made a covenant before me in the house that bears my name. <span id="chapter34_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>But then you turned around and profaned my name by bringing back your male and female slaves whom you had freed according to their desire,<span id="footnotesource300"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote300">*</a> and you forced them back into slavery.’</p>
<p id="p1043" data-pid="1043" class="p1043 sb"><span id="chapter34_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>“Therefore this is what Jehovah says: ‘You have not obeyed me in proclaiming liberty, each one to his brother and to his fellow man.
