<p id="p294" data-pid="294" class="p294 sb"><span id="chapter35_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him: “Get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst, and cleanse yourselves and change your garments, <span id="chapter35_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>and let us rise and go up to Bethʹel. There I will make an altar to the true God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever<span id="footnotesource262"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote262">*</a> I have gone.” <span id="chapter35_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings that were in their ears, and Jacob buried<span id="footnotesource263"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote263">*</a> them under the big tree that was close to Sheʹchem.</p>
<p id="p295" data-pid="295" class="p295 sb"><span id="pos139803"></span><span id="chapter35_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When they traveled on, the terror of God struck the cities around them, so they did not chase after the sons of Jacob. <span id="chapter35_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jacob eventually came to Luz, that is, Bethʹel, in the land of Caʹnaan, he and all the people with him. <span id="chapter35_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>There he built an altar and called the place El-bethʹel,<span id="footnotesource264"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote264">*</a> because there the true God had revealed himself to him when he had run away from his brother. <span id="chapter35_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Later Debʹo·rah, Re·bekʹah’s nurse, died and was buried at the foot of Bethʹel under an oak. So he named it Alʹlon-bacʹuth.<span id="footnotesource265"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote265">*</a></p>
<p id="p296" data-pid="296" class="p296 sb"><span id="chapter35_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>God appeared to Jacob once again while he was coming from Padʹdan-aʹram and blessed him. <span id="chapter35_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>God said to him: “Your name is Jacob. Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel will be your name.” And he began to call him Israel. <span id="chapter35_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>God further said to him: “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and become many. Nations and a congregation of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you.<span id="footnotesource266"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote266">*</a> <span id="chapter35_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>As for the land that I have given to Abraham and to Isaac, to you I will <span id="page89" class="pageNum" data-no="89" data-before-text="89"></span>give it, and to your offspring<span id="footnotesource267"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote267">*</a> after you I will give the land.” <span id="chapter35_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.</p>
<p id="p297" data-pid="297" class="p297 sb"><span id="chapter35_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. <span id="chapter35_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>And Jacob continued to call the place where God had spoken with him Bethʹel.</p>
<p id="p298" data-pid="298" class="p298 sb"><span id="pos141199"></span><span id="chapter35_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Then they pulled away from Bethʹel. And while they were still some distance from Ephʹrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was very difficult. <span id="chapter35_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>But while she was struggling to deliver the child, the midwife said to her: “Do not be afraid, for you will have this son also.” <span id="chapter35_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Just as her life was slipping away<span id="footnotesource268"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote268">*</a> (for she was dying), she named him Ben-oʹni,<span id="footnotesource269"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote269">*</a> but his father called him Benjamin.<span id="footnotesource270"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote270">*</a> <span id="chapter35_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephʹrath, that is, Bethʹle·hem. <span id="chapter35_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.</p>
<p id="p299" data-pid="299" class="p299 sb"><span id="pos141798"></span><span id="chapter35_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>After that Israel pulled away and pitched his tent a distance beyond the tower of Eʹder. <span id="chapter35_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Once while Israel was dwelling in that land, Reuʹben went and lay down with Bilʹhah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard about it.</p>
<p id="p300" data-pid="300" class="p300 sb">So there were 12 sons of Jacob. <span id="chapter35_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>The sons by Leʹah were Jacob’s firstborn Reuʹben, then Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, Judah, Isʹsa·char, and Zebʹu·lun. <span id="chapter35_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>The sons by Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. <span id="chapter35_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>And the sons by Bilʹhah, Rachel’s servant, were Dan and Naphʹta·li. <span id="chapter35_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>And the sons by Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s servant, were Gad and Ashʹer. These are Jacob’s sons, who were born to him in Padʹdan-aʹram.</p>
<p id="p301" data-pid="301" class="p301 sb"><span id="pos142442"></span><span id="chapter35_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Jacob eventually came to where his father Isaac was at Mamʹre, to Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, that is, Hebʹron, where Abraham and also Isaac had resided as foreigners. <span id="chapter35_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Isaac lived to be 180 years old. <span id="chapter35_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Then Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people,<span id="footnotesource271"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote271">*</a> after a long and satisfying life;<span id="footnotesource272"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote272">*</a> and his sons Eʹsau and Jacob buried him.</p>
