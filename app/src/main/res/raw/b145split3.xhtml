<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="p17 sb"><span id="pos10167"></span><span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>But Jesus departed for the sea along with his disciples, and a great multitude from Galʹi·lee and from Ju·deʹa followed him. <span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Even from Jerusalem and from Id·u·meʹa and from across the Jordan and from around Tyre and Siʹdon, a great multitude <span id="page1353" class="pageNum" data-no="1353" data-before-text="1353"></span>came to him when they heard about the many things he was doing. <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that the crowd would not press in on him. <span id="chapter3_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Because he cured many, all those who had serious diseases were crowding around him to touch him. <span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Even the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, would fall down before him and cry out and say: “You are the Son of God.” <span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>But many times he sternly ordered them not to make him known.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="p18 sb"><span id="pos10904"></span><span id="chapter3_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>He ascended a mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him. <span id="chapter3_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>And he formed<span id="footnotesource12"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a> a group of 12, whom he also named apostles, those who were to accompany him and whom he would send out to preach <span id="chapter3_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>and to have authority to expel demons.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="p19 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>And the group of 12 that he formed<span id="footnotesource13"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote13">*</a> were Simon, to whom he also gave the name Peter, <span id="chapter3_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>James the son of Zebʹe·dee and John the brother of James (he also gave these the name Bo·a·nerʹges, which means “Sons of Thunder”), <span id="chapter3_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Andrew, Philip, Bar·tholʹo·mew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Al·phaeʹus, Thad·daeʹus, Simon the Ca·na·naeʹan,<span id="footnotesource14"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote14">*</a> <span id="chapter3_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>and Judas Is·carʹi·ot, who later betrayed him.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="p20 sb">Then he went into a house, <span id="pos11613"></span><span id="chapter3_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>and again the crowd gathered, so that they were not able even to eat a meal. <span id="chapter3_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>But when his relatives heard about it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying: “He has gone out of his mind.” <span id="chapter3_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Also, the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying: “He has Be·elʹze·bub,<span id="footnotesource15"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote15">*</a> and he expels the demons by means of the ruler of the demons.” <span id="chapter3_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>So after calling them to him, he spoke to them with illustrations: “How can Satan expel Satan? <span id="chapter3_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>If a kingdom becomes divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand; <span id="chapter3_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>and if a house becomes divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. <span id="chapter3_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Also, if Satan has risen up against himself and has become divided, he cannot stand but is coming to an end. <span id="chapter3_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>In fact, no one who enters the house of a strong man is able to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Only then can he plunder his house. <span id="chapter3_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Truly I say to you that all things will be forgiven the sons of men, no matter what sins they commit and what blasphemies they speak. <span id="chapter3_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>But whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever but is guilty of everlasting sin.” <span id="chapter3_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>He said this because they were saying: “He has an unclean spirit.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="p21 sb"><span id="pos12871"></span><span id="chapter3_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>Now his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. <span id="chapter3_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>As there was a crowd sitting around him, they said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.” <span id="chapter3_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>But he replied to them: “Who are my mother and my brothers?” <span id="chapter3_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>Then he looked at those sitting around him in a circle and said: “See, my mother and my brothers! <span id="chapter3_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.”</p>
