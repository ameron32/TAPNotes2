On both sides of the river were trees of life producing 12 crops of fruit, yielding their fruit each month. And the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations.</p>
<p id="p141" data-pid="141" class="p141 sb"><span id="chapter22_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>And there will no longer be any curse. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his slaves will offer him sacred service; <span id="chapter22_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. <span id="chapter22_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Also, night will be no more, and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight, for Jehovah<span id="footnotesource122"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote122">*</a> God will shed light upon them, and they will rule as kings forever and ever.</p>
<p id="p142" data-pid="142" class="p142 sb"><span id="pos64354"></span><span id="chapter22_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>He said to me: “These words are faithful<span id="footnotesource123"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote123">*</a> and true; yes, Jehovah,<span id="footnotesource124"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote124">*</a> the God who inspired the prophets, has sent his angel to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place. <span id="chapter22_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Look!

<p id="p143" data-pid="143" class="p143 sb"><span id="chapter22_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Well I, John, was the one hearing and seeing these things. <span id="page1661" class="pageNum" data-no="1661" data-before-text="1661"></span>When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things. <span id="chapter22_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers the prophets and of those observing the words of this scroll. Worship God.”</p>
<p id="p144" data-pid="144" class="p144 sb"><span id="chapter22_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>He also tells me: “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the appointed time is near. <span id="chapter22_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Let the one who is unrighteous continue in unrighteousness, and let the filthy one continue in his filth; but let the righteous one continue in righteousness, and let the holy one continue in holiness.</p>
