This is a lasting obligation for Israel. <span id="chapter2_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all the other gods. <span id="chapter2_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>And who is up to the task of building him a house? For the heavens and the heaven of the heavens cannot contain him, so who am I that I should build him a house except as a place for making sacrifices smoke before him? <span id="chapter2_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Now send me a craftsman who is skilled in working in gold, silver, copper, iron, purple wool, crimson, and blue thread and who knows how to cut engravings. He will work in Judah and in Jerusalem with my skilled craftsmen, whom David my father has provided. <span id="chapter2_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>And send me timbers of cedar, juniper, and algum from Lebʹa·non, for I well know that your servants are experienced at cutting down the trees of Lebʹa·non. My servants will work along with your servants <span id="chapter2_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>to prepare for me great quantities of timber, for the house that I am to build will be extraordinarily great. <span id="chapter2_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Now look! I will supply the food for your servants, the woodcutters who cut down the trees: 20,000 cors<span id="footnotesource12"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a> of wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths<span id="footnotesource13"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote13">*</a> of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil.”</p>

He can do every sort of engraving and make any design he is given. He will work with your own skilled craftsmen and the skilled craftsmen of my lord David your father. <span id="chapter2_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Now let my lord send the wheat, barley, oil, and wine he has promised to his servants. <span id="chapter2_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>And we will cut down trees from Lebʹa·non, as many as you need, and we will bring them to you as rafts by sea to Jopʹpa; and you will take them up to Jerusalem.”</p>
