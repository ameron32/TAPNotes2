<p id="p233" data-pid="233" class="p233 sb"><span id="chapter29_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Moses then called together all Israel and said to them: “You have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharʹaoh and all his servants and all his land, <span id="chapter29_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>the great judgments<span id="footnotesource192"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote192">*</a> that your eyes saw, those great signs and miracles. <span id="chapter29_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>But Jehovah has not given you a heart to understand and eyes to see and ears to hear, down to this day. <span id="chapter29_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>‘While I kept guiding you for 40 years in the wilderness, your garments did not wear out on you and your sandals did not wear out on your feet. <span id="chapter29_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>You did not eat bread, and you did not drink wine or anything alcoholic, so that you would know that I am Jehovah your God.’ <span id="chapter29_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>You eventually came to this place, and Siʹhon the king of Heshʹbon and Og the king of Baʹshan came out to meet us in battle, but we defeated them. <span id="chapter29_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>After that we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reuʹben·ites, the Gadʹites, and the half tribe of the Ma·nasʹsites. <span id="chapter29_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Therefore, observe the words of this covenant and obey them, so that everything you do will turn out well.</p>
<p id="p234" data-pid="234" class="p234 sb"><span id="chapter29_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>“All of you are stationed today before Jehovah your God, the heads of your tribes, your elders, your officers, every man of Israel, <span id="chapter29_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>your children, your wives, and your foreign resident who is in the midst of your camp, from the one gathering your wood to the one drawing your water. <span id="chapter29_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>You are here in order to enter into the covenant of Jehovah your God and his oath, which Jehovah your God is making with you today <span id="chapter29_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>in order that he may establish you today as his people and that he may be your God, just as he has promised you and just as he swore to your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>

What caused this great, burning anger?’ <span id="chapter29_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Then they will say, ‘It was because they abandoned the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their forefathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. <span id="chapter29_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>But they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods that they had not known and that he had not permitted them to worship.<span id="footnotesource195"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote195">*</a> <span id="chapter29_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah’s burning anger came against that land by bringing upon it the entire curse written in this book. <span id="chapter29_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Therefore, Jehovah uprooted them from their soil in his anger and fury and great indignation and deported them to another land, where they are today.’</p>
