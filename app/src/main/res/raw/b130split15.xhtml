Or do people make a peg from it to hang utensils on? <span id="chapter15_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Look! It is thrown into the fire for fuel, and the fire consumes both ends and scorches the middle. Is it now fit for any work? <span id="chapter15_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Even when it was whole, it could not be used for anything. How much less useful it will be when the fire has consumed and scorched it!”</p>

They have escaped from the fire, but fire will consume them. And you will have to know that I am Jehovah when I set my face against them.’”</p>
