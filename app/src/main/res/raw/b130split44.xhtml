It is not to be opened, and no human will enter by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, has entered through it, so it must remain shut. <span id="chapter44_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>However, the chieftain will sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah, for he is a chieftain.

When I looked, I saw that the glory of Jehovah had filled the temple of Jehovah. So I fell with my face to the ground. <span id="chapter44_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah said to me: “Son of man, pay attention,<span id="footnotesource345"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote345">*</a> watch, and listen carefully to everything I tell you about the statutes and the laws of the temple of Jehovah. Pay close attention to the entryway of the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary. <span id="chapter44_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>You must say to the rebellious house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “That is enough of your detestable practices, O house of Israel. <span id="chapter44_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When you bring foreigners who are uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary, they profane my temple. You present my bread, fat, and blood, while my covenant is being broken because of all your detestable practices. <span id="chapter44_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>You have not taken care of my holy things.

They will slaughter the whole burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they will stand before the people to minister to them. <span id="chapter44_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Because they ministered to them before their disgusting idols and became a stumbling block causing the house of Israel to sin, that is why I have raised my hand against them in an oath,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘and they will bear the consequences of their error. <span id="chapter44_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>They will not approach me to serve as my priests or approach any of my holy or most holy things, and they will bear their shame because of the detestable things that they did. <span id="chapter44_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But I will make them caretakers of the responsibilities of the temple, to take care of its service and all the things that should be done in it.’</p>
