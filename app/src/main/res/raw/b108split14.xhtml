Our wives and children will become plunder. Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?” <span id="chapter14_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>They were even saying to one another: “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt!”</p>

<p id="p147" data-pid="147" class="p147 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>However, all the assembly talked of stoning them. But Jehovah’s glory appeared on the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.</p>
<p id="p148" data-pid="148" class="p148 sb"><span id="pos69983"></span><span id="chapter14_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah said to Moses: “How much longer will this people treat me without respect, and how much longer will they not put faith in me in spite of all the signs that I performed among them? <span id="chapter14_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Let me strike them with pestilence and drive them away, and let me make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.”</p>
<p id="p149" data-pid="149" class="p149 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>But Moses said to Jehovah: “Then the Egyptians, from whose midst you brought this people out by your power, will hear, <span id="chapter14_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>and they will speak about it to the inhabitants of this land. These also have heard that you, Jehovah, are among this people and have appeared to them face-to-face. You are Jehovah, and your cloud is standing over them, and you are going before them in the pillar of cloud by day and in the pillar of fire by night. <span id="chapter14_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>If you put this people to death all at once,<span id="footnotesource98"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote98">*</a> the nations who have heard of your fame would say this: <span id="chapter14_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>‘Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ <span id="chapter14_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Please, now, Jehovah, let your power be great, as you promised when you said: <span id="chapter14_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>‘Jehovah, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love,<span id="footnotesource99"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote99">*</a> pardoning error and transgression, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.’ <span id="chapter14_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Forgive, please, the error of this people according to your great loyal love, just as you have pardoned this people from Egypt until now.”</p>
<p id="p150" data-pid="150" class="p150 sb"><span id="pos71509"></span><span id="chapter14_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah said: “I forgive them according to your word. <span id="chapter14_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>But on the other hand, as surely as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah. <span id="chapter14_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>However, not one of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness and yet have kept testing me these ten times and have not listened to my voice <span id="chapter14_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>will ever see the land about which I swore to their fathers. No, not one of those treating me without respect will see it. <span id="chapter14_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>But because my servant Caʹleb had a different spirit and kept following after me wholeheartedly, I will certainly bring him into the land where he went, and his offspring will take possession of it. <span id="chapter14_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Since the A·malʹek·ites and <span id="page238" class="pageNum" data-no="238" data-before-text="238"></span>the Caʹnaan·ites are dwelling in the valley,<span id="footnotesource100"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote100">*</a> you should turn back tomorrow and set off for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”</p>
<p id="p151" data-pid="151" class="p151 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Jehovah then said to Moses and Aaron: <span id="chapter14_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>“How much longer will this evil assembly keep up this murmuring against me?
